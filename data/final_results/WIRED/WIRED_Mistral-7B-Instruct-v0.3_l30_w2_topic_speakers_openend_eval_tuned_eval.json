that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","1":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","2":"For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.","3":"You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?","4":"A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff. How do you have the courage to make a choice?","5":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major. And there's something you once taught me. You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd.","6":"And there's that chord. It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord. But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to.","7":"But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution. I get myself in a situation. (keyboard music)","8":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","9":"Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.","10":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","11":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","12":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","13":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","14":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","15":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","16":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","17":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","18":"So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at. And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day. So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us.","19":"Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star. So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?","20":"There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.","21":"[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe. But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular.","22":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","23":"Not an experimental one. So, our theme here today is dimensions. So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way.","24":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","25":"Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.","26":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","27":"So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.","28":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","29":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","30":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","31":"And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.","32":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","33":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","34":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","35":"Yeah, that's right. And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time.","36":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","37":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","38":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","39":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","40":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","41":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","42":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","43":"Someone probably wrote it for him. So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse. It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that. So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about.","44":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","45":"Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?","46":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","47":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","48":"And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time. So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison. Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?","49":"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field. It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.","50":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","51":"The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--","52":"But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.","53":"You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.","54":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","55":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","56":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","57":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","58":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","59":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","60":"So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like.","61":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","62":"We don't know. You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see.","63":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","64":"So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes. The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now. It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole. LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes. The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it. These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries.","65":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","66":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","67":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","68":"Maybe four three. People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening. See if it works for you. [Woman] Wow.","69":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","70":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","71":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","72":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","73":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","74":"Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.","75":"Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm. But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?","76":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","77":"That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?","78":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","79":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","80":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","81":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","82":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","83":"But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.","84":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","85":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","86":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","87":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","88":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","89":"That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.","90":"There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.","91":"The optical applications are in development. The science has really been worked out. The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there. For example, some of them are made from cadmium. Cadmium's toxic. You would never put that in someone's body. But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those. So have you learned about graphene?","92":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","93":"You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.","94":"Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.","95":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","96":"That's true. Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.? Do you think that makes sense?","97":"Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?","98":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","99":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","100":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","101":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","102":"I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.","103":"The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?","104":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","105":"Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.","106":"I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.","107":"It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way. But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done.","108":"Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.","109":"And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.","110":"These are great questions. So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think. And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity.","111":"I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions. And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us. I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play. And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable.","112":"A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.","113":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","114":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","115":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","116":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","117":"Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.","118":"So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult. But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.","119":"Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.","120":"And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)","121":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","122":"Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions? Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply.","123":"I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems. So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?","124":"So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.","125":"This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving.","126":"This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening. Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in. So do you think that's a big crisis? The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?","127":"So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.","128":"That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.","129":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","130":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","131":"So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description. It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly. It's like saying, is French or is English real?","132":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","133":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","134":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","135":"It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.","136":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","137":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","138":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","139":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","140":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","141":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","142":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","143":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","144":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","145":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","146":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","147":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","148":"I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?","149":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","150":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","151":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","152":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","153":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","154":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","155":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","156":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","157":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","158":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","159":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","160":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","161":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","162":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","163":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","164":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","165":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","166":"So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?","167":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","168":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","169":"Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?","170":"That was a perfect explanation. But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them. Would you think that would be pretty cool?","171":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","172":"You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality? Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today. What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool. People get an amazing response from it. But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality.","173":"Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.","174":"There was a huge concern about that at Oculus. And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well. They were very, very concerned. I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things. That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again. I tried it that time and it was terrible. And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that. And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it. Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this.","175":"So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.","176":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","177":"You're in total free fall. Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness. It's called the equivalence principle. It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling.","178":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","179":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","180":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","181":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","182":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","183":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","184":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","185":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","186":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","187":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","188":"Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.","189":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","190":"That's right. And we could live there. The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape.","191":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And you can append it. You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","192":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","193":"Well, we have a lot of public blockchains. Like we have Bitcoin. We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.","194":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","195":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","196":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","197":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","198":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","199":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","200":"So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains. And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute. So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student. And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis.","201":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","202":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","203":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","204":"I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine. I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?","205":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","206":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","207":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","208":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","209":"I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.","210":"It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?","211":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","212":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","213":"Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller.","214":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","215":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","216":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","217":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","218":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","219":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","220":"So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time. And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture. So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it. In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye. And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to. And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen.","221":"Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?","222":"All right, so we're gonna start in F, right? Yeah. So say. \u266a I once \u266a F, yeah. (Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah. F. C. F. So we're home.","223":"Just to see how things feel. Yeah. All right, lets do it. (both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A. Which is F seven over A. (both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man.","224":"Oh, very good. You've come to the right place. So we're gonna think about physics. Have you heard the word physics before? Do you know what that is?","225":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","226":"And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?","227":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","228":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","229":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","230":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","231":"Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?","232":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","233":"It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from. And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room. If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore. And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed. But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal.","234":"So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way. If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it. And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches. And some things are impossible.","235":"Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.","236":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","237":"Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience.","238":"So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?","239":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","240":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","241":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","242":"Okay, but that's kind of cheating. That's not getting to 10 to the 29. If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need.","243":"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.","244":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","245":"So it is amazing, the parallels. And optics is used everywhere. We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers. It's everywhere. And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.","246":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","247":"Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?","248":"But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.","249":"Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?","250":"You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.","251":"It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down. Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information. They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them.","252":"You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?","253":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","254":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","255":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","256":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","257":"You don't have a cat. So you don't need a cat toy no. Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?","258":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","259":"Oh you got to see a shooting star? Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there. So what do you think about lasers? You think they're fun?","260":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","261":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","262":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","263":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","264":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","265":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","266":"So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","267":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","268":"Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.","269":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","270":"One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere. You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?","271":"Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.","272":"I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?","273":"Because I can delay the gratification of going home. First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord. One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note.","274":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","275":"So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side. The perfect and the play goal. The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know? And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)","276":"Exactly, yeah. No, for sure. And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up.","277":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","278":"I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other.","279":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","280":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","281":"Like how can that possibly be? What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination without revealing the combination to you. And what you could do is you could write a little note, a secret that I definitely wouldn't know. Fold it up, stick it in here. And then, if I know the combination, I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote. All right. There we go. All right. So,My dog is named Doug. Did you figure out what the combination was?","282":"So you're asking like, why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody? People don't trust each other. And if I was able to prove that I've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets, then that person would trust me more.","283":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","284":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","285":"Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?","286":"I've got one too. I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco. Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye. And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen. And something about that that carried me forward. Something happened so long ago, it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do.","287":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","288":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","289":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","290":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","291":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","292":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","293":"Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?","294":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","295":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","296":"Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?","297":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","298":"So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity. Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations. Infinite sets are somehow very exotic. They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.","299":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","300":"So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.","301":"That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.","302":"Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets. And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks. Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning. A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms. And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past. And they're not just completely separate. We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.","303":"The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know, the idea is always, oh, I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again. Z squared plus C or something like that. When I think about fractals, I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask, what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal. And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?","304":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","305":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","306":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","307":"And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.","308":"So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.","309":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.","310":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","311":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","312":"Exactly. So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us. While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things. Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.","313":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","314":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","315":"What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.","316":"And the way we're gonna approach this is through something called NP-completeness. What an NP-complete problem is, it's a problem that's really hard to solve. But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool.","317":"Of course, the first step is we have to erase all the colors. What I've done is I've put a color inside each of these envelopes. Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring? You don't. Right? You have to pick any two neighboring countries. You can pick them however you like. At random.","318":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","319":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","320":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","321":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","322":"It's not about making something more efficient. It's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before. I can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly. Right? I could prove to you that I signed some encrypted document correctly. Right? Without revealing to you what that secret document was. That ability to change the game. Like, really just change what we can do is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.","323":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","324":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","325":"I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?","326":"So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility? What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?","327":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","328":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","329":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","330":"The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?","331":"You got it. And so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things. We remember the things that matter to us the most. So Abigail based on our conversation today, can you tell me what is a memory?","332":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","333":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","334":"Yeah, totally.  Like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about.","335":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","336":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","337":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","338":"Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.","339":"In a way, it's part of the same continuum. What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively. The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.","340":"One of the key challenges, I think for all, any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times. And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better? So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity. But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well.","341":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","342":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","343":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","344":"So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other. You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample.","345":"I would tend to agree that I think, in some sense, anything that uses superposition could be a quantum sensor, but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60, 70 years. I think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique? How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?","346":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","347":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","348":"exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","349":"it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know","350":"you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them","351":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","352":"Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.","353":"So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics, which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you. So that's really nice, right? It's saving you a lot of work, but the downside is you lose a lot of control. So because the only thing you're describing is this short little program, you don't have complete control over how this is gonna end up. And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years. So how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about?","354":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","355":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","356":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","357":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","358":"In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade. So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11. And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people. How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router? 100 megabits per second not enough?","359":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","360":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","361":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","362":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","363":"So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?","364":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","365":"So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see? What are you sensitive to? So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile. So there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive at the same time.","366":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","367":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","368":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","369":"We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.","370":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","371":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","372":"Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.","373":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","374":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","375":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","376":"So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.","377":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","378":"Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.","379":"Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?","380":"Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.","381":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","382":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","383":"so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers","384":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","385":"simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems","386":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","387":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","388":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","389":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","390":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","391":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","392":"So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?","393":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","394":"So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.","395":"That's right. So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say. That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta. So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.","396":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","397":"My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data. And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data. That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.","398":"I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility. Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?","399":"Absolutely. I don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question. What was so, such a beautiful insight, as I'm sure you know, is that the idea of zero-knowledge","400":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","401":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","402":"We're definitely at this moment now, where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more. There are so many conferences and meetings that occur in the zero-knowledge space, where you and I are not invited. Because it's for the people who are developing. You know, the people who are programming, not us mathematicians.","403":"It's a great question. I wish I could see the future. I can't actually, but let me try. The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side.","404":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","405":"Yeah, I think it's a really good question. The only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars. So it's sensible to think, well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough, but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun, maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun if they merge. To get to millions and billions, and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take, there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime. So they must have come from somewhere else.","406":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","407":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","408":"Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.","409":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","410":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","411":"you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down","412":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","413":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","414":"yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one","415":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out","416":"I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that, if we provide more structure and support, and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience in the algorithm, that should make it more efficient. And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient.","417":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","418":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","419":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","420":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","421":"Right, so some people have called that the flattening of the internet, right? I think it used to be on average, you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination.","422":"I mean, even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted. So you don't know what they're saying, just even knowing two devices are communicating.","423":"You're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know. I'm curious, just to pick your brain, what do you think are some of the hot topics in networking research? Where do you think the field is heading?","424":"You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.","425":"Coming back again to the softwarization. SDN and softwarization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers, that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G. You just see an increase in speed. But yet, the way the network is now being managed again, I think is bringing the cellular networking world sort of into the internet world in terms of the softwarization-","426":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","427":"It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?","428":"So from the outside, if you're an astronaut, you're watching your friend, another astronaut going into the black hole, it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other. So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside, looking at this round event horizon, you think of the center of black hole as a point in space, but to the person who's fallen in, it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time. The singularity, or the end of it all, the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future. So they can no more avoid the singularity than you can avoid the next instant of time coming. So the death in the singularity is inevitable. Although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists.","429":"I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?","430":"The beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is. So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.","431":"So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and in the process of evaporates. And of course this caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates, eventually that event horizons is yanked up. And the question is, where did everything go that had once fallen in?","432":"Do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about, the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about, whether it will pan out or not, will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?","433":"Right, and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly, without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use to actually behave honestly. So we of course know that zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages plays such a huge role in cryptography. I'm curious. What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?","434":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","435":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","436":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","437":"Everything you just said is exactly what we know from research. All the thoughts running through your mind, were really at kind of about a prediction into the future, right? You're like, how, how will this taste if, when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision down the road? You know we think of memory as something in the past, but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present. But you did it, you made your way through that torture. And now you've got to keep the candy.","438":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","439":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","440":"Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?","441":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","442":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","443":"It's really interesting. And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory, right? Because the maps are dependent on memories, they're built from memories and experiences. So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps, maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories, affecting the maps, and really makes me think even of a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward. But then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model.","444":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","445":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","446":"It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.","447":"It's a really good question. Only this instrument, and that's why it was so hard to build. And by the time it gets here, it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances. Has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation?","448":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","449":"I like that description, because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing. Is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex, like playing chess?","450":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","451":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","452":"Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?","453":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","454":"You know when I look back at, some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general, I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before, but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question. I think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision-making. There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory, and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes. And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before.","455":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","456":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","457":"So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is. Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics. So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object. It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.","458":"That's a great question. So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback. It's similar to how you might train a dog.","459":"It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.","460":"I think that robotics is really, really hard. Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard. So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.","461":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","462":"I think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations, like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale and variant, you know, this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are, but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales. And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.","463":"Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation. Computation is recursive kind of biased nature. And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also-","464":"I think that's also, what's so beautiful about fractals is that, you know, if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well, Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying, well, geometry is all about in variance. I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal.","465":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","466":"People outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature, for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena. Do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know, this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural descriptions and we're, we're moving on from that?","467":"So one of the things I guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of, with which everybody can create these worlds. Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just, you know, trained computer scientists. One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working about this program, Bryce, this one I felt like I could really use, what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in, in people's hands, making it easier for people to use procedural machine learning, to build these kind of worlds?","468":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","469":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","470":"Yeah, absolutely not. Because this room holds only a finite amount of space. And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see. Really how does that make you feel?","471":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","472":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","473":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","474":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","475":"but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated","476":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","477":"And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom. In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them. So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.","478":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","479":"So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields. They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors. Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground."},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","2":"Explainer: Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.\nExplainee: In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","3":"Explainer: For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.\nExplainer: And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","4":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","5":"Explainer: A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life. They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony. How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff.

There's material there. If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling. And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty. So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing.\nExplainee: So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","21":"Explainer: There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity. And we don't have that yet. So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form. The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time. So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation. The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves. And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that.\nExplainee: Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: [Sean] Being four dimensional, right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: Let's bring one in. All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.\nExplainee: I see.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved. So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?\nExplainee: I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox. Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train. Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating. So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: It's quantum.

Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?\nExplainee: I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: You haven't? Okay.\nExplainee: So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things. I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving. I'm doing the color-space right. But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds. Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing. And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things. I don't think that its necessary. I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded. And I think its a lovely aesthetic. I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing. While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness. And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic. While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good. And you can buy that you're in that place. And you want to know what's around that monolith over there.\nExplainee: We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset. We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading. And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself. And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey. You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is. I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainer: The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time. And basically, we've achieved it. Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views. And we understand the light really well. Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things. So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality. However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law. Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--\nExplainee: Or bandwidth, or streaming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now. We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication. So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively. Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced. If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable.\nExplainee: And there's constantly novel UX innovations. Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move. And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking. I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential. But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.\nExplainee: So, there's like how many dimension would there be?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: So far, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them. They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?\nExplainee: I'm in the fours. In the fours?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?\nExplainee: I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.\nExplainee: I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.\nExplainee: Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?\nExplainee: Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?\nExplainee: Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology. So all the way from like 0D to 3D. If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: That's correct. Yeah. Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material. So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right? But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap. And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different. And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size.\nExplainee: What are the applications of these quantum dots?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers. There are companies that are building displays from these materials. And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry.\nExplainee: How far away is this from being actually used on an industrial level?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.\nExplainee: So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes. So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: You're speaking my language. This is what I spent many years of my life working on. You don't physically roll up graphene. You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface. And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition. So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes. Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want. So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want. I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another. And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to. And it's still very much in the research stage. The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials.\nExplainee: In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know. And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get. And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?\nExplainee: Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats. Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?\nExplainee: Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: You mean flipping bits within flash?\nExplainee: Yeah, exactly, right. So flipping it in this sort of flash memory. And so someone's done it with x-rays. There's actually, I forget who now. There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting. Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side. Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right? We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it. And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both.\nExplainee: Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious. I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to. A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right? And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works. So making something like that for fault injection. So all kind of older logic and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip. You know, voltage switcher. That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself. So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right? It's like people don't know about it sometimes. Like, even engineers designing systems. It's new to a lot of people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--\nExplainee: But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else. If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant. Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole.\nExplainee: So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it. So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right.\nExplainee: So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to, like, detect a black hole, besides if it's, if things are close enough that they're being pulled in, so it's basically a theory?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality.\nExplainee: And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage? We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: Right. And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system. And so, it can make many of these problems much worse.\nExplainee: Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary. And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that? How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point? What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage? I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks? Why was it collected this way? What are the limitations of it? We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process. This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate.\nExplainee: What have you seen in terms of which industries, where they stand, like who is adopting now? Who is ready to utilize it? Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try? [Hilary laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it. So what do you think is holding us back?\nExplainee: I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes. I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent. And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening. But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected. So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out. And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared. And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--\nExplainee: So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things. But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that. So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one. And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared. So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared. So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure.\nExplainee: So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?\nExplainee: The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up. So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together. And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole. And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight. But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole. All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be. But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion. So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on.\nExplainee: Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd. I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind. And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant. And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)\nExplainee: Yeah, that might be, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?\nExplainee: Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts. That's a question I'm just interested in, in general. When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things. Have you ever run into this yourself? And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?\nExplainee: Yeah, it's a really tricky question. As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words. So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other. So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it. It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance. And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen. And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?\nExplainee: Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet. One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples.\nExplainee: Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea. So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics. And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: Practical purposes.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity.\nExplainee: One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds. And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together. So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined. So I think that's the loophole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: I mean, temperature is still great to talk about. It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature. I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature. But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated. And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics.\nExplainee: Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same. On one side there's definitely no gravity. On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means. But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: because it suddenly changes shape.\nExplainee: I have seen these before, my friends use these.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.\nExplainee: OK.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: That's a really good question. It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\nExplainee: Camera.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?\nExplainee: What inputs would you normally use to hack?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\nExplainee: How long does it take to get in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Would it be cool to have that power?\nExplainee: Uh yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology. Have you ever heard of this word before?\nExplainee: Nhn nhn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?\nExplainee: Yes. I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots. They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses. And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things. You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there. And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology. Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world.\nExplainee: So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something. And those are pretty interesting. I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually. For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound. And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you. So I think those are pretty significant.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","174":"Explainer: Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places. But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function. Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you. But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at. And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot. It all comes down to all these trade-offs.\nExplainee: You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else. Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","175":"Explainer: So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?\nExplainee: I'm taught that it's a force. It's described by inverse law. But I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.\nExplainee: So, in free fall?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.\nExplainee: So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory? Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?\nExplainee: So we have three spatial dimensions. A brane is sort of the next level. So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: [Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I have. Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged. And it gets verified by a third person or third party. And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right? It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?\nExplainee: The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas. It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it. But I'm not sure where it's going to go. I mean, no one really knows, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.\nExplainee: Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.\nExplainee: So the thing I'm most excited about sleep research is, I think, first of all, this complexity of the daytime\/nighttime sleep, what sleep is really doing to our body and to our brain, and then is really from the epidemiologic or public health perspective, how we can best use sleep as a tool for the detection and prevention of neurodegeneration in the long-term.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties. What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now.\nExplainee: Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale. So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well. This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it. This is a nano composite material. If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets. And I studied that as a graduate student. I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing. You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate. That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure. And so you think that's great. Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that? And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea. But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago? So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells. Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts? Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainer: You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: Nice, okay cool. Lets try one more version where we add some colors. Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about some science. Do you like science?\nExplainee: Yes, a lot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: Exactly. It's not really one dimensional, right?\nExplainee: So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?\nExplainee: Yeah, I have. So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like. It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time. For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label. Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels. That's the thing we're trying to discover. So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes. You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully. Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions.\nExplainee: With reinforcement learning versus deep learning, it seems to me that reinforcement learning, is it sort of like the kitchen sink approach that you were talking about earlier, where you're just kind of trying everything?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: [Hilary] Yes. [both laugh]\nExplainee: Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost. Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","235":"Explainer: You build a system that could actually be useless. So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn. It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was. So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month. But they had no idea what to do about it. And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes.\nExplainee: Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","236":"Explainer: Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","237":"Explainer: Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient, actually.\nExplainee: If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram without, you know, more information about myelination or glial cells, all types of environmental features that surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete picture, no doubt.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible. I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains? Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?\nExplainee: Are you still doing EM or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: That's right, if you can do that, go for it.\nExplainee: And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is? What do you see the real excitement being?\nExplainee: I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this? We already got light. Now we can't live without lasers. My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors. How is that made? With lasers. All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers. Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter. That came out of the laser fusion program.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.\nExplainee: I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack. We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","248":"Explainer: Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory. That other memory is really important stuff. So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address. So that return address could essentially be another address in memory. So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code. And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload. So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering.\nExplainee: So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit. More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power. If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there. So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows. So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks? Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering? But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of? What got you interested in computer science and information security?\nExplainee: I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran. I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is. Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right? They have essentially censored internet. In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms. While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding.\nExplainee: There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology. I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations. We should know how to control it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: Oh really? Oh excellent. Well I'm somebody who studies lasers. So what do you think about lasers?\nExplainee: I don't know--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainer: So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?\nExplainee: I don't have a cat or--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.\nExplainee: Well I saw a shooting star before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: [Bettina] Exactly.\nExplainee: That's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: Okay. As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things? Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening. So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up? Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom. And so the question really is how do you make that? Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?\nExplainee: Vaguely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major. \u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know? Is there another verse to come?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: Yeah. so this is the note F.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.\nExplainee: But what about negative harmony, the dark side?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: You know, you changed the feeling of it, what otherwise would, you know, if you were to tell a kid that this is a major song, we should be happy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: But if you arrive in F major from A major, then it's like the sun's gone in.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: In one brain, in your brain. Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer? Would that computer then be you?\nExplainee: Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: You have not. Right. It's a way for a prover to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing anything about why it's true, which sounds totally bizarre. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: So nowhere in this interaction, did you see any information that you didn't already know. And yet I convinced you that I know the combination. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah. So what's the exact purpose of a zero-knowledge proof? Is it like proving something but without giving enough information that could endanger whatever it is that you're proving?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential in your, in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?\nExplainee: I was probably six years old and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer, she battled it for 20 years. She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope, it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes. So they just, that memory will never be forgotten my whole life.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities. And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already. But it's also totally different. It has some very weird properties. Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel. Unlike an ordinary hotel, has accountably infinitely many rooms. Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that. The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away. So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest. I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along. It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it? \nExplainee: It'll be in room number one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?\nExplainee: Yes. You're going up one each time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.\nExplainee: How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.\nExplainee: So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: So you can think of robotics as having two core components. One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm. And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult. If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful. One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world. On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write. But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic. One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.\nExplainee: Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data? Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets, Is that what's keeping us behind?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: That's a great question. I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own. And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.\nExplainee: What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: Do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?\nExplainee: It would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers. I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","304":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.\nExplainee: Four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: And so what this box counting is getting at is saying, well, I still can never decide what the length of the coastline is, but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one dimensional curve, like a line or a circle.\nExplainee: Yeah, I've, I've heard about that. Where if you, if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline, you can actually change like how much of the coast that, that there is like if you measure in mile lengths, you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: So procedural computer graphics, which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance, consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detail the textures. So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way, then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects.\nExplainee: Is there any other interesting applications of fractals?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot. Something like stacking these two cups. Do you think that's easy or hard?\nExplainee: If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was? Or did we tell it to just move over here?\nExplainee: We told it to just move over here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.\nExplainee: Will I, like, understand that it's true because like, you know, the operations performed in the proof are like, of a certain, like, you know, they have like, certain attributes that would make them true?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: What you're basically asking is, wait, what? Right? Right. So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating, and so counter-intuitive. And I think the best way I can explain it to you is by means of an example. But before we do that, I have to decide what I'm gonna prove to you in a, with a zero-knowledge proof.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: Without revealing what the address is of your account. It turns out I can take that statement that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins, and convert it into a map of countries. And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.\nExplainee: How would we turn something like this into a zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: You would use encryption. Right. But it's really, this is the protocol.\nExplainee: So what are the broader implications of like, zero-knowledge proofs. Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like, implementation, and or, are they supposed to like, structurally prove something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.\nExplainee: It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist? You're getting into philosophy of math now. It's just exciting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance. I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?\nExplainee: The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about? And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?\nExplainee: I do know that there's different parts of the brain. So there's probably a part of your brain that remembers a bunch of stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it, it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me what happened that day, all these details of that day. There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?\nExplainee: Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself. Then your brain makes a note and says don't get too close to sharp things, or you're going to cut yourself again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: I think I agree with you, but I think to really validate our scientific experiment, we should probably compare the length of the string. A lot of extra slack in that pig of string. So what we noticed with great Britain is we were never able to measure it's length. It just kept getting longer and longer. This is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline, but it depends on how you measure it. Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate, we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline. But really there's so much detail. We would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is. Fractals also give us a really nice language. We're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is. And actually a lot of people, engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals and this language of fractals to compare different shapes, not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness. So based on everything we talked about today, how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words?\nExplainee: It's a shape, that you can't describe as a shape.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: Okay.\nExplainee: For solar panels. Then, that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now is quantum computings. And what about you? What got you interested in quantum sensing?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance. Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.\nExplainee: So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: Yeah. And that's why you're able to do it at room temperature as well.\nExplainee: What are some of the challenges you face when trying to do quantum sensing with this platform?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\nExplainee: But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.\nExplainee: So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: Maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation. So I don't have a strong view on it, but I do think it's an interesting question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip\nExplainee: I was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing. He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information\nExplainee: The great power of a quantum computer is also it's Achilles's heel. That it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects. You're just multiplying your problems if all your doing is adding qubits.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography\nExplainee: (laughing) Right, in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage. We're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up. It's still very very very early in the development of the field.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.\nExplainee: How long does this process take?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: Well, because people who really need to use these subdivision services for everything, people who worked hard over the years to make this super, super fast. In fact, subdivision services were invented basically at Pixar. There's this guy, Ed Capel, and he was harshly responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called Capel Clark subdivision surfaces. And in fact recently won the touring award for these subdivision services.\nExplainee: What do you think are the current shortcomings in, I guess applying fractals to computer science right now, what are, what is the cutting edge?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.\nExplainee: When can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond? Is that created? Do you like, put energy into it or?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.\nExplainee: Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.\nExplainee: You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia. You can talk to them at the same time, and like you're reaching the same signals. So how is it that it gets there so fast?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.\nExplainee: And I was wondering how there's so many different movies or TV shows that you can download and they're all there. And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\nExplainee: So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: Great. So now I have a much harder question. So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers. Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers? What do you think?\nExplainee: By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers. I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\nExplainee: So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?\nExplainee: I guess again, intuition seems like it must be much larger, but I don't know, I haven't been on a roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers. This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable. What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list. Okay, so here's how we do this. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements. So I'll highlight them. This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.\nExplainee: If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: Yes. You see the idea right away. So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one. And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere. Why is that?\nExplainee: Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work \nExplainee: Not much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers\nExplainee: They read like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines\nExplainee: But as like a programmer, how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?\nExplainee: Yeah, I've used it like that. I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: So there's certainly no stop to this procedure. But could you give a precise cardinality to that?\nExplainee: would be a set of all sets, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality. And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process. When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets? This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets. So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory. One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck. This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal. It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory. It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.\nExplainee: So you're just making a cutoff point. You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.\nExplainee: No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average. But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute. That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: Do you think they'll share it?\nExplainee: Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value. Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: [Amit] Right.\nExplainee: So what's your take on why knowledge is, rather than information, or zero-data proof. Clearly, there's data there. So can't be zero-data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","402":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: general knowledge of proof in the ledger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","403":"Explainer: And I think that's a sign. That's a sign that our baby has grown up and, you know, it's time for it to be developed.\nExplainee: I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me, what are the future direction, both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof, in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","404":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","405":"Explainer: Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?\nExplainee: So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no, but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-\nExplainee: And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and do for a merger event at some point. So given a sufficiently low velocity, we would just have two big galaxies that, for the most part, pass through each other, pass by each other. But given a sufficiently high velocity, we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right\nExplainee: So in a classical computer, you know, you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but I guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question\nExplainee: Interesting, so what do those algorithms look like?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful. Factoring, those are definitely useful things that I would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","416":"Explainer: How can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster?\nExplainee: From my experience, it's a matter of how much support you give the, like, robot when it's learning. One could be like a narrower task range. Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","418":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","419":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","420":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","421":"Explainer: Yeah, do you see the softwarization of the internet as a whole happening?\nExplainee: So, so far, it hasn't very much. I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","422":"Explainer: And certainly, we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out, or certain kinds of traffic in. So there's no global body that is regulating that?\nExplainee: Not really because each country really can have it's own laws and its own norms. And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","423":"Explainer: So you can infer or guess a lot of things.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","424":"Explainer: So you want the computation close to where the endpoint is.\nExplainee: Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking and cloud, which are normally three different communities, three different sets of technologies, three different sets of standards or practices, now have to work together in close harmony to be able to service applications that are really critical and that that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is a potential concern.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","425":"Explainer: You know, we've had cellular networks now for 20, 30 years. So when we hear about 5G, what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh, super high bandwidth, right? But I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster.\nExplainee: I agree. It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay so that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real-time. It's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication. It's about having more coverage.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: What is your impression of what a black hole is?\nExplainee: I'm a senior at NYU. I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.\nExplainee: So it's a star that has collapsed. It has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon. So once you get past the event horizon, nothing, not even light can escape from that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: It turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole, its electric charge, its mass, and its spin. So the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged. Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed. If a star collapses, it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that formsbwill likely be spinning. A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties. So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles, which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object. Have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole?\nExplainee: I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes, which is a black hole that is static, a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole, which is a black hole that rotates, but what makes a black hole static versus rotating? And what's more common?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: So the singularity is definitely predicted in Einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of spacetime. And in the theory of spacetime, there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole. Now, even when people talked about singularities back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics. It's not just gravity. And if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form.\nExplainee: I sort of know what a singularity is. I think of it as something where everything is compacted into one single point, it's a place where the laws of physics don't exactly work out. What did you mean when you said that you don't think the singularity really exists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: I would say to some extent we don't know for sure. What we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper. Just very recently, within the past couple of years, the first ever human-procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon. So Jayda, after our conversation today, what would you say a black hole is?\nExplainee: So since we obviously have never been to a black hole, how do we know for sure, like, what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole? Is it just like, inferred from the math?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes.\nExplainee: Hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved. But Hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game. He really that if you took that into account, that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black, that actually things can escape from black holes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse, and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them. And then there's this domain that we're talking about, where, as you said, black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality. And that makes them really unusually special. And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature. So there's the matter forces, and then the outlier is gravity. We've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with. Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself. And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.\nExplainee: The pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be. I think what's exciting about physics, about theoretical physics, that you start following a thread, you start developing a chain of logic, and you never know where it's gonna end up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: That's near and dear to my heart. Multi-party computations.\nExplainee: Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving. But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge actually goes even further beyond that. It's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation, where you wanna accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.\nExplainee: Exactly, and then also like after it was like, maybe like I would've, enjoyed this more than that and like maybe I should've chose the other one. And you don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","440":"Explainer: That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.\nExplainee: Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","441":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","442":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","443":"Explainer: We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation. And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions in memory research, or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like, well what is the connection? What is the connection between spatial processing and memory? And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating a maze, why is it that there's spatial specialization there? I really do think that this notion of a mental model, a generative model is where those, where memory and space meet.\nExplainee: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right? And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we, that our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in. But I think it opens a lot up, a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps, right? And then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","444":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","445":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","446":"Explainer: Okay, you wanna do the demo for me? So the LIGO instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with its very complicated instrument. It stands for Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed. I think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar. And then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording, just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string. Now just play it like a little bit. And you can't hear anything, right? You're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in. What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing, but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound. And this is like the gravitational waves, which are ringing the drum of spacetime, but so quietly that they're not move the air and we're not hearing them. So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit. While I can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves, I can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier. And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.\nExplainee: How do you know that it's like the black hole that's making this sound and nothing else?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","447":"Explainer: It's a great question. If I didn't see you playing the guitar, I would recognize the sound of a guitar. And even if I had never heard of a guitar before I could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing, I could tell how strongly it had been plucked, and I could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string. And I can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play. So I can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it. And it's very similar to LIGO, we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics, and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that. And they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole.\nExplainee: Is there anything that like gets affected on Earth because of those waves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","448":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","449":"Explainer: I think it's interesting. And also a huge challenge. I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable, they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things. It's a huge challenge, because that's actually not the case.\nExplainee: When we think about babies on their social cognition, we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is. An agent is something that's self-propelled, that has its own internal states, like goals and beliefs. And so, it's very natural to imagine that when you see a seemingly, they call it propulsive, action by a robot, you're thinking, 'Hey, this thing has a desire. It has a goal. It's accomplishing it with its. So what if I give it a different goal? Why couldn't it do that?' They call it promiscuous generalization about agents, right? I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face. I think that my computer's mad at me. And so I think it, the challenge actually is to stop people from doing that, and to recognize limitations where there are some. Or we bring to bear our knowledge, sometimes incredibly quickly, to parse an uncertain image. So our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","450":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","451":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","452":"Explainer: Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.\nExplainee: Oh, absolutely. I think this sort of reminds me of another project that I'm doing. It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli, but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study. I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else. And I definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","453":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","454":"Explainer: I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.\nExplainee: In people with intact brains, you might use a particular process, but if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","455":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","456":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","457":"Explainer: Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?\nExplainee: From the sound.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","458":"Explainer: Yeah. It's really unintuitive. In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything. Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that. So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.\nExplainee: So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","459":"Explainer: We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers. Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B. And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers. And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world. There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.\nExplainee: Can a robot ever go off the program?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","460":"Explainer: It depends on how you program the robot. If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program. It will always do those actions. But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.\nExplainee: Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","461":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","462":"Explainer: Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?\nExplainee: And I think that's one of the things that's exciting about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","463":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah I actually actually remember the moment when I finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics, I was working for this company, Maggi and Disney was working on a movie. I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","464":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then you get it all.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","465":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","466":"Explainer: Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.\nExplainee: Scaling is a simple thing yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","467":"Explainer: Absolutely.\nExplainee: Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore, to store an entire world in your computer.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","468":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things.

And more importantly, what are the key discoveries about the brain mechanisms that regulate sleep?","2":"And if we consider dopamine in terms of the interventions, as you asked, taking amphetamines is primarily intended to promote wakefulness and may even interfere with the quality of sleep by preventing the normal restorative processes during REM sleep, especially when used in excess or for prolonged periods. However, modafinil, though it acts on dopamine, is specifically designed as a wake-promoting agent for those who experience excessive daytime sleepiness. Modafinil is less likely to interfere with sleep quality compared to amphetamines as it selectively targets wake-promoting areas in the brain without significantly affecting dopamine reuptake, thus its use is generally more controlled and less risky.","3":"Or does it cause a break in sleep cycles altogether, leading to poor quality sleep?","4":"If we look at Western music theory, the major triad is built by stacking thirds, with the root note at the bottom, a major third above it, and another major third above that.","5":"But the key is to trust your instincts. They guide you towards the harmony that resonates with you, and that's what makes your music unique.","6":"I think the song Don't Follow the Crowd is in D flat major. And what you taught me was that every key has a relative minor. So, the relative minor key of D flat major is B minor.","7":"So, that's a rare kind of chord progression. It's not typically found in standard pop or rock songs, but it can create a unique, slightly dissonant and interesting sound, often used in jazz or blues music. You might find it in a ii-VII-I progression where the VII chord is a major seven with a sharp five, for example, D7#5 in the key of G major, which would lead to a G major chord.","8":"What I didn't know at that time, but I figured out later, was that it was using an augmented 6th chord.","9":" So, in the context of piano playing, when we talk about inversion, it means rearranging the intervals in a chord. For instance, if we have a C major (C, E, G) chord, in first inversion, the C is placed at the bass, the E forms the middle note and the G now is the top note, forming a G major (G, B, C) chord. Similarly, in second inversion, the E becomes the bass, the C lies in the middle, and the G is the top note, forming a C major (C, G, B) chord.","10":null,"11":"It's a popular hymn, and it has a very simple harmonic structure. The tune is in the key of F major. It's essentially a three-chord progression: F, C7, and F. This progression repeats throughout the hymn with different melodies.","12":null,"13":"Why does it sound better to you? Can we identify the specific notes or chords that make it pleasing to your ear?","14":"Yeah, and not just the hardware improvement, but the software engineers' creativity and the game designers' vision will also play a crucial role in enhancing the VR gaming experience. For instance, they can come up with innovative game mechanics to provide more intuitive and interactive gameplay. Additionally, with advancements in artificial intelligence, NPCs can become more intelligent, responsive, and dynamic. Overall, we can expect a more immersive and engaging VR gaming world in the future.","15":"It's like anything you can imagine, you can create a VR experience for it.","16":"You are correct in understanding that as machine learning. The computers or robots you refer to are utilizing algorithms that help them learn patterns and make decisions autonomously.","17":"In addition, Spotify's algorithms consider the user's listening history and the patterns of music preferences to make personalized recommendations.","18":" Well, machines can perform calculations and analyze data much faster and more accurately than humans. They can make complex decisions and predictions based on large amounts of data. However, machines lack human emotions, creativity, and the ability to understand and interpret the world in a holistic manner. While machines can mimic human behaviors to a certain extent, they will never be able to truly comprehend humor, art, love, or other deeply human experiences.","19":"That's unimaginably dense. For comparison, a teaspoon of water weighs about 53 grams on Earth. If we use that as our unit, one teaspoon of this hypothetical stuff would have a weight equivalent to about 18 quintillion times the weight of a teaspoon of water. Or in terms of energy, it would release an equivalent amount of energy to a hydrogen bomb several times over just by resting on your hand.","20":"Yes, from the outside, it appears that there is no space-time inside a black hole. This is because the gravitational pull is so strong that it curves space-time itself, and anything that crosses the event horizon gets pulled towards the singularity, the point where space-time itself ends. Therefore, it\u2019s currently impossible to say what, if anything, actually exists inside a black hole.","21":"For instance, detecting such waves would provide us with valuable insights into the properties of neutron stars, such as their radius and mass distribution, thereby further deepening our understanding of these extreme astrophysical phenomena.","22":"I believe that was because it offered us a direct opportunity to prove our understanding of gravity.","23":"So, you might study fields like string theory, quantum mechanics, or cosmology to explore properties of dimensions beyond the three we're familiar with in our daily lives.","24":"We have four space dimensions (length, width, height, time in space-time), but we don't have a tactile or 'touch' dimension, for example.","25":"Well, the way Einstein did this was by coming up with his field equations. These equations tell us how the curvature of spacetime, which we can think of as a fabric, is related to energy and matter. This allows us to describe how the shape of spacetime changes around different objects, like planets and stars. Now, when you're standing on a flat surface, like a table, the surface remains flat and you can move around freely. But if the surface is curved, like a sphere, your ability to move around is restricted. In the same way, the presence of massive objects curves the fabric of spacetime, causing it to behave differently, affecting how time and space are experienced. In other words, the four-dimensional spacetime represents a combination of three-dimensional space, which we move around in, and single-dimensional time, which describes the passage of events. And this idea that the structure of spacetime is dependent on matter and energy is at the heart of Einstein's relativity and the understanding of gravity as curvature of spacetime.","26":"Because as you move along the timeline, you are simultaneously moving through space, and the distance between two events can depend on the relative motion of the observers. Therefore, in relativity, space and time are intimately mixed into four-dimensional spacetime.","27":"So, in the context of special relativity, spacetime can be thought of as a four-dimensional space-time continuum, where the additional dimension, Z, represents time. And just like in three-dimensional Euclidean space, you can have curves or paths within spacetime and calculate a distance between two points\u2014but that distance, or interval, can now depend on the velocity of the observer and the curvature of the spacetime trajectory. This is why it becomes essential to consider spacetime as a fundamental aspect of our physical reality.","28":"So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older. Now, suppose you put a flag at the exact spot where you started and in that moment, the whole universe stopped. So that spot, that moment, that flag is a single point in spacetime. You'd call it an event in 4D spacetime language. That point has three spatial coordinates (from your current spot in space) and one temporal coordinate (from when the event occurred). So a single event in spacetime has four dimensions: three spatial and one temporal.","29":"But, time is still moving for me here. I'm still 'traveling 24 hours into the future' just by being here instead of on the rocket ship. Traveling through spacetime means moving through both space and time, not just space or just time.","30":"Yes, exactly, it's a measure of time that accounts for the distortion or warping of spacetime due to the presence of mass and energy. Proper time is essentially the time experienced by an observer moving in such a curved spacetime.","31":"But depending on their speed and direction, they might perceive different values of the same T. This concept is known as Relative Time, which is a central idea in Special Relativity.","32":"Well, the person who sat in their chair, their experience of time was relative to their physical dimension, which was confined to the room they were in. However, the person who zoomed out had a wider physical dimension, which allowed them to experience both a wider space and, because of the effects of special relativity, an expanded view of time as well.","33":"So, length, width, and height form the dimensions of an object. The length can be described as a straight line from one end to the other, the width as the distance across the thickest part, and the height as the distance from the bottom to the top of the object, depending on its orientation.","34":"So it is similar to if you had a sheet and you dropped a book on it. The book would cause the sheet to curve downwards, and if the sheet was tightly stretched, like in the case of spacetime, the curvature would depend on the mass of the book just as in the case of planets and stars. In the case of spacetime, the more massive an object is, the greater the curvature it creates.","35":"It's important to note that the concept of space and time changes depending on the observer's speed relative to the other. The faster we move, the more space and time get distorted for us, due to the effects of curvature in spacetime. This means that objects that we believe to be at a certain distance and moving at a certain speed, for a faster observer, would appear closer and moving slower, or vice versa. The classic example of this phenomenon is the twin paradox, which demonstrates a scenario where one twin experiences gravitational time dilation while the other travels through spacetime. In conclusion, relativity teaches us that space, time, and their interplay are subjective, with phenomena like time dilation and space contraction arising from these subjective perspectives.","36":null,"37":"I'm really glad you like it. Let's continue working on it later.","38":"if you imagine wrapping up this tube, you can have the possibility that it can spontaneously contract. This contraction can happen via some phase transition, akin to the way water transitions from liquid to solid when it freezes.","39":"We typically generate the initial dimensions randomly within a specified range, and then we allow them to evolve based on the dynamics of the system and the interactions between the dimensions.","40":"But contrary to how it might sound, these branes aren't material objects. Instead, they are hypothetical extended objects in the context of string theory, characterized by the number of dimensions they occupy. Strings vibrate through these dimensions, producing various particles we see in our universe.","41":"So essentially, you would have a universe where the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant balance each other, keeping a multidimensional sphere at a fixed distance from a point singularity, while the remaining dimensions asymptote to a fixed radius, extending infinitely far in all directions.","42":"Not necessarily. The solutions with the lowest action under certain conditions would be the ones that are preferred. But the choice of the cosmological constant in the transverse dimensions can still lead to a variety of solutions depending on the specific conditions you're considering.","43":"Because the nature of quantum physics is not easy to understand for most people, particularly due to the counter-intuitive phenomena like superposition and entanglement. So the Matrix representation might help people visualize these complex concepts.","44":"Gravity is what brings objects, like us, toward the center of the Earth. However, black holes are the regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. So, black holes don't help to keep us on the Earth; instead, they are spaces in the universe where the pull of gravity is much stronger than anywhere else in the universe.","45":"Try imagining my hand waving in front of the person you are focusing on.","46":"That's amazing! You can see things in this virtual world as if they were really there in front of you. But remember, they're just created by the computer.","47":"Yeah, if you're interested in learning more about lasers in general, they are directed beams of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is produced by a process called stimulated emission. In terms of applications, lasers are used in a wide variety of areas, like surveying, medicine, telecommunications, and more. If you're just interested in the laser you use, specifically, I'd be happy to discuss that too.","48":"So, the main difference is that in a continuous wave laser, the power is delivered continuously over time, while in a chirped pulse amplification system, the power is delivered in extremely short pulses. This is achieved by stretching the pulse, amplifying it, and then compressing it to a shorter duration, enabling the delivery of high power in a short time span.","49":"Well, with current technology, it's difficult to go beyond terawatts (THz). That's approximately a trillion watts. The National ignition Facility (NIF) holds the record for the most powerful laser, producing petawatt (PW) level energy.","50":"Perhaps we could consider using a femtosecond laser pulses, which have high enough peak power to create a photothermal or photomechanical effect to destroy the cell, while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue due to their short duration.","51":"That is a very insightful point, and I completely agree. The magic of embracing a low-poly aesthetic and co-presence of other creatures can create a unique and deeply immersive experience, as you demonstrated with Life of Us. I think it's fascinating how such an approach can help put us at ease and allow us to more fully embrace the virtual reality, rather than being constantly reminded of its artificiality. This approach could potentially be applied to other VR projects as well. It's a great reminder that sometimes, less can indeed be more.","52":"the semiconductor industry is unable to keep up with Moore's Law, which means we might not have the necessary computing power for infinite VR rendering any time soon. But perhaps we'll see breakthroughs in other areas like quantum computing or more advanced stream processing technologies to help us cope with this limitation.","53":"It also requires addressing the issues of motion-sickness, latency and creating a more immersive and lifelike experience. Also, we need to consider developing new hardware and software technologies that can support advanced VR features and make it more accessible to a wider audience.","54":"I completely agree, and one crucial aspect will be ensuring the ethical and philosophical implications of creating synthetic people are addressed. We need to consider questions about agency, consent, and identity. If we can navigate these complexities, we could unlock a new realm of storytelling and immersion beyond our wildest dreams.","55":"That's great! I studied biology too, but I found mathematics and physics fascinating. The abstract and mathematical nature of physics is appealing to me.","56":"Well, a dimension is simply a measure of size or extent in a certain direction. For example, length, width, and height are the three dimensions for a three-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. However, it's not uncommon to talk about higher or lower dimensions as well, such as the fourth dimension which can represent time, or even theoretical dimensions beyond that. Do you have any specific questions about dimensions?","57":"Now, imagine there's another line, and you're keeping the two lines at right angles. You now have two dimensions.","58":"Well, one of them is a coordinate system called XYZ, where the Z-axis is perpendicular to the XY plane allowing us to define and represent height or depth dimension.","59":null,"60":"So, you could say that the RA (Right Ascension) represents the longitude and the Dec (declination) represents the latitude of a celestial body.","61":"So, each part you can eat is a kind of dimension of the whole orange, right?","62":"Well, we usually talk about 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, however, when describing the universe, astronomers often include a 4th spatial dimension, the angle of direction in the universe, and possibly even higher dimensions depending on the theory.","63":"It's because the standard model fails to fully account for gravity, which is fundamental to understanding the dimensions in our universe. In essence, we don't yet have a quantum theory of gravity, which makes it difficult to accurately describe and understand the number of dimensions in our universe.","64":"It's a significant challenge, as black holes don't emit or reflect light themselves. However, scientists can indirectly study them by observing the effects of their immense gravitational pull on surrounding matter, like stars and gas. The Event Horizon Telescope project you mentioned is an international collaboration aiming to capture direct images of black holes, including the one in our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, by connecting a network of radio telescopes worldwide to effectively act as a single, enormous telescope. This provides us with an unprecedented level of detail and resolution, allowing us to see the black hole's event horizon and gain insights into these mysterious objects.","65":"Gravity pulls us towards the Earth, keeping us on the ground instead of floating off into space.","66":" The Moon's pull makes the Earth rotate a little bit faster and keeps one side of the Earth facing the Moon. This is why we have tides.","67":"No, not really. Gravity is what keeps us on the ground. If gravity was too strong, we would be pulled too hard, and we wouldn't be able to lift ourselves up because we wouldn't have enough energy against it.","68":"Around 4 feet tall, I think.","69":"So, when astronauts are in space, they are not subjected to gravity. Lack of gravity makes the spinal discs expand. When the astronaut came back to Earth, gravity made the spinal discs compress again, making him appear shorter than before. But without the pulling force of gravity on his body while in space, he became taller. This difference in height was significant enough to distinguish him from his twin brother who was staying on Earth","70":"It's said that Galileo was the first to explain that objects fall because of gravity and not because they are pushed by the air. Newton developed the theory of gravity, explaining it through the force of attraction between two objects with mass.","71":"Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other. The force of gravity depends on how much mass two objects have and the distance between them. Since the Earth has a lot of mass compared to things on its surface, it pulls anything near it towards its center.","72":"A heavy object falls faster than a light one.","73":"But, if you often find yourself tired during the day, it might be a sign that you need more than six hours. Also, consider factors like stress and sleep quality","74":"I think the need for sleep varies for individuals due to factors like genetics, lifestyle, and psychological health, which can affect the quality and amount of sleep a person gets. For instance, stress or anxiety can interfere with the sleep-wake cycle, ultimately reducing the amount of sleep a person needs. Additionally, certain health conditions, such as sleep apnea or chronic pain, can also impact the amount of sleep required.","75":"You're correct, that situation can mess with sleep schedules, which can lead to issues like sleeping disorders or fatigue. Our bodies have an internal clock, separate from the external light cycle, which synchronizes with the environment to maintain regular sleep-wake patterns. This internal clock is influenced by sunlight and other day-night cues to regulate sleep-wake cycles (circadian rhythm). When day lengths vary drastically, it can disrupt the internal clock's timing, and thus the circadian rhythm. This can result in sleep disturbances, if the individual's internal clock doesn't align with the external environment's light-dark cues. Solutions might include exposure to bright sunlight during the day to enhance the synchronization of the internal clock and adjusting sleep schedules to better match the light-dark cycle.","76":"it's actually a beam of light, but it's different from the light produced by a light bulb due to the way it's produced","77":"Explainee: The force is more concentrated as the area is smaller, so the sharp end can cause more damage or penetrate more easily into the piece of wood.","78":"That is correct, just like a magnifying glass concentrates sunlight to burn a piece of paper, a lens in a laser concentrates light to cut or drill materials.","79":"so if we pulse the laser, we can create a very high power in a small area and for a short time, giving us a high intensity light source.","80":"concentrated using the lens.","81":"I was told it would revolutionize our understanding of the universe, but that wasn't really the case. Instead, it got people excited about the idea of something so unknown and mysterious.","82":"You know, sleep is essential for our brains to process, consolidate, and store memories, and for our overall health. It's fascinating how much our sleep habits can affect our cognitive function and our emotional well-being.","83":null,"84":"It's not exactly accurate to tell how much sleep someone's getting solely by measuring REM. The total sleep duration is usually calculated by the length of time a person spends in bed minus the period they are awake for. However, REM sleep stage can help determine the quality of sleep, as well as assessing sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or REM sleep behavior disorder. If someone is interested, I recommend getting a sleep diary to track their sleep habits.","85":"Right, that's correct. REM sleep isn't related to the N stages, it's a different type of sleep. Distractions like technology, light, and music can interrupt your sleep cycle and make it harder to reach the deep sleep stages (N1, N2, N3), not necessarily REM sleep. However, these distractions can still reduce the overall quality of your sleep, making it less restorative.","86":"But it is normal for sleep scientists to observe subjects during sleep stages for hours at a time to gather detailed data.","87":"Well, if you understand quantum mechanics, then you should already know something about quantum computers, which are devices that use quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. These phenomena allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much more efficiently than classical computers. This is because quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) that can represent more than just 0s and 1s, unlike classical bits. Instead, qubits can be in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time, and can also become entangled with each other. The superposition property lets quantum computers perform multiple calculations simultaneously, while the entanglement property allows them to share information faster. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize many fields, such as cryptography, chemistry, and artificial intelligence. Now, with the development of nanotechnology, it's becoming possible to build quantum computers on a small scale, possibly even at the nanometer scale. Nanotechnology refers to the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. It can be used to create materials and devices with novel properties, such as extreme strength, temperature resistance, and electrical conductivity. The intersection of quantum computing and nanotechnology is a very exciting area of research, with the potential to bring about rapid advances in a variety of technological fields.","88":"Quantum dots consist of semiconductor material that is engineered to be really small, usually between 2 to 10 nanometers in diameter. They are known for their unique optical and electronic properties due to quantum confinement effect, meaning the confinement of charge carriers within the small crystalline structure. Their size can be tuned to exhibit different colors, making them useful in various applications such as LEDs, solar cells, and bio-imaging.","89":null,"90":"The applications of these quantum dots are numerous, ranging from solar cells, display devices, and biolabeling where their precise tunability of emission wavelengths and long luminescence lifetimes make them particularly useful.","91":"It's currently in the research phase and still a long way from being used on an industrial level. The challenges lie in developing stable formulations, increasing yield, and ensuring safety and efficacy for medical applications.","92":"Yes, exactly. And how do you think we can develop a stronger and lighter material using it?","93":"Well, the synthesis process is key to controlling the diameter of the carbon nanotubes. The most common method is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where a hydrocarbon gas is heated in the presence of a catalyst, often a metal like nickel or cobalt. The carbon atoms in the gas stick to the catalyst and form nanotubes as they grow. The diameters of these nanotubes can be controlled by changing the growth temperature, the concentration of the hydrocarbon gas, or the type and size of the catalyst particles.","94":"Explainee: And one of the materials that you were just mentioning is graphene, right?","95":"Yes, those are indeed quantum dots based lighting. The light they emit is a result of the properties of quantum dots that I work with in my research.","96":"and that's what we generally refer to as their respective characteristics.","97":"Machine learning is like doing reviews before the test. You don't know what you're going to get on the test, but you learn what patterns to look for so you can solve the problems. The same way, in machine learning, we don't know exactly what data we'll be fed, but we train the computer to recognize patterns so it can make decisions based on that data.","98":"So, the machine learning system is acting just like you, learning from its mistakes and improving. In your case, after each test, you learn from the questions you got wrong and improve your understanding. Similarly, the machine learns from the incorrect outputs it produces and adjusts itself to perform better.","99":"to discuss about the connectome and its function in our brain.","100":"And did you know that a big group of cells in the brain is connected together in a special way? This connection is called connectome. Knowing the connectome of the brain can help us understand how our brains work.","101":"You're essentially telling the device that it has authenticated correctly, despite it not having done the correct math, which makes the device vulnerable to attacks.","102":"It seems like you're discussing a method to manipulate flash memory using X-rays. If I'm understanding correctly, you've mentioned that someone has managed to do this by focusing the X-ray source through a plate with a hole, hence the term 'flipping bits within flash'. I'm curious, could you tell me more about how this process affects the overall read and write integrity of the flash memory?","103":"I think it's important to raise awareness about these vulnerabilities and the methods to exploit them. It's not only about understanding the intricacies of fault injection, but also about recognizing the potential risks and taking necessary precautions. So, with your DIY kit approach, you're not only making it easier for people to understand the concept, but also encouraging a proactive approach to securing systems.","104":"It looks like there's an increasing focus on improving product security in the industry as you mentioned. This will likely push the attack strategies to become more sophisticated and demanding, pushing researchers to keep innovating and find new methods to bypass these enhanced securities. New areas of interest might be exploration into stealthy attacks, AI-based evasion techniques, and supply chain attacks, which are areas where academia has not yet fully delved into.","105":"That's where it gets interesting. According to the laws of physics, it creates a boundary known as the event horizon beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. This is what makes a black hole 'black'.","106":"There are several movies and TV shows that try to depict space and physics accurately to some extent. For instance, 'Interstellar' and 'The Martian' attempt to portray concepts such as general relativity and the effects of gravity in space quite reasonably. However, it's important to remember that movies, like any form of media, have to balance accuracy with storytelling, so some license is often taken for the sake of entertainment.","107":"It's basically a theory, but we have indirect evidence to prove their existence, such as X-ray emissions from nearby stars, which are believed to be caused by gas swirling around a black hole before it gets sucked in.","108":"Explainer: Well, transparency is crucial. You need to be able to explain how the model works and what assumptions it makes. This can help users understand the decisions the model is making and help identify any potential biases. It's also important to continuously monitor and address any biases that are discovered. This involves not only correcting the model, but also revisiting the data collection process and the societal assumptions that may have influenced it.","109":"It's important to consider regulatory guidelines, ethical standards, and societal expectations in developing machine learning systems. This includes ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness in decision-making processes. Additionally, implementing methods to control and mitigate biases in both the collection and usage of data is crucial. Continuous evaluation and improvement, especially in the early stages of development, can help in adjusting the system to address potential issues and maintain its usefulness while being socially acceptable.","110":"I've seen varying adoption rates across industries. Some like finance and healthcare are rapidly adopting machine learning due to its potential for improved efficiency and decision-making. On the other hand, certain industries like retail have seen more hesitance, as they're still figuring out how to effectively incorporate machine learning into their existing systems. I wish those who are hesitant wouldn't shy away completely, as there's a lot of potential for growth and improvement through the use of machine learning.","111":null,"112":null,"113":"Originami are not cut. Instead, they are folded from a single sheet of paper.","114":"Yes, all the folds are reversible.","115":"Oh, so as it unfolds, the center square spins around vertically. That's why you call it a 'twist'.","116":"Correct! It\u2019s essentially a neural wiring diagram which provides a comprehensive description of the neural connections in the brain. This includes the different paths that information travels through as it pertains to various brain functions, resulting in common neural patterns among individuals.","117":"I would need to perform additional analysis to obtain the exact dimensions of the accretion disk, but by studying how long it takes for the pulse to propagate from the black hole to the accretion disk and then to the dust, I can infer the size of the system to some degree. However, the exact resolution and dimensions would require more data or a larger telescope.","118":"with information from the change in brightness in different wavelengths, we can infer the location of the dust, with the brightest near the black hole and the faintest at the furthest points","119":"So the point I'm trying to make is, even though you're in your own galaxy, there are black holes of much larger mass than the X-ray binaries, which are about 10 solar masses. Furthermore, the recent observations by LIGO have confirmed the long-theorized phenomenon of neutron stars and black holes merging, and we now have evidence of a process where a neutron star, after merging with another neutron star, becomes heavy enough to collapse and form a black hole.","120":"I think this could be due to the difficulty in detecting black holes without an accretion disk, as neutron stars have their own pulsations that make them easier to spot. Additionally, black holes might have been formed through different mechanisms, such as pair-inststanton or collapsars, which might not create a remnant that can be detected after the supernova explosion.","121":"The gravitational pull of the black hole is so intense that not even light can escape. This is known as the event horizon. So, contrary to popular belief, a black hole doesn't swallow everything, it just removes it from our visible universe.","122":"One possible approach could be to conduct an experiment where you train a deep learning model with the extracted features from the text and compare its performance with a traditional model that uses features extracted using lexicons or template matching techniques. This way, you could evaluate the benefits and limitations of both approaches in the context of the debate data.","123":"I agree with you that the question of bias in models is indeed tricky. A quantitative approach could involve collecting a large dataset of the model's predictions and comparing the results for different gendered prompts to assess any noticeable disparities. However, it's crucial to remember that the model is trained on the data it has seen, and thus, it may reproduce the biases present in that data. Therefore, it's essential for the creators of these systems to make the data sources and the potential biases clearly understood, so users can weigh the risks for their specific use cases.","124":null,"125":"This uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, when applied to the black hole scenario, theoretically allows for pairs of virtual particles to form just outside the event horizon. One of these particles falls into the black hole while the other escapes, thus creating what is known as Hawking radiation.","126":"so, as the black hole radiates energy this way, it loses its mass and will eventually disappear (evaporate), which is known as Hawking Radiation.","127":"That's why, from an engineering perspective, we often ignore the complexities of Einstein's theory of general relativity when we're dealing with everyday objects on a small scale.","128":"So I think that's why we need to look for effects that are independent of the presence or position of the horizon, like Hawking radiation, to see if there really is a violation of the no-hair theorem or if the event horizon is more of a statistical artifact in the quantum description of gravity. In other words, we might just be failing to properly account for all the possible quantum states, and the event horizon might be an emergent phenomenon rather than a hard boundary.","129":"So what you're saying is, holography provides a way to represent the 3D or higher-dimensional gravitational information in a compact, 2D form. This aligns well with the way a hologram works, creating a 3D image from a 2D surface. Now, in the context of your experiment, could we interpret the wave function peak as a kind of 'holographic' projection of the 3D gravitational information onto a 2D space, thus preserving the requirements of classical relativity?","130":"But that doesn't mean we should ignore the limitations of our understanding and keep exploring the mysteries of gravity, trying to uncover its hidden aspects, and push the boundaries of what we currently think is possible.","131":"Explainee: But that doesn't necessarily mean that in between those two sides, there's no gravity at all. It's just that at the quantum level, gravity behaves differently, and it's this holographic description that helps us connect the two worlds.","132":"Here you go. Here is a piece of origani. Enjoy.","133":null,"134":"So, I'm going to fold a piece of paper in a specific way to make a crane, just like people have been doing for hundreds of years. Let's get started.","135":"And then, you should be able to see the origami flower design taking shape. You'll have something that looks like a bloomed flower.","136":"What's a cootie catcher? It's a fortune teller, a paper game where you ask 'yes' or 'no' questions and it gives you an answer according to which flap you open.","137":"So, these are origami. That's a traditional Japanese art form where you create decorative designs by folding paper, like what your friends do.","138":null,"139":"But when it comes to implementing a blockchain solution at scale, it's a different ball game. We are still exploring the best practices and use cases, and it requires a lot of collaboration, experimentation, and iteration.","140":"For example, if a person wants to transfer money, it can take days for the transaction to be processed. And, there's a risk of fraud and errors in the current system.","141":"Right, but that's unrealistic. We don't expect blockchain to eliminate all fraud overnight. It's a tool to help us reduce fraud and increase transparency. Just like self-driving cars, it's about gradual improvement and learning from mistakes.","142":"It's illegal and unethical and can result in severe consequences, including legal penalties.","143":"So they would try to help them by informing them about the vulnerability and suggesting solutions to fix the lock, making it safer for everyone.","144":"I started coding to create harmless, fun programs, but soon I found that people were getting annoyed by some of my pranks. Then I switched to ethical hacking.","145":"you could share it with them or show them how to do it themselves. That way, they too can enjoy the benefits of your idea.","146":"It's a field of research and application of technology that involves manipulating materials at a small scale, typically between 1 and 100 nanometers. This scale enables new properties and applications for materials. It's not entirely science fiction, but it's certainly at the edge of what we can achieve with current technology.","147":"It's a silicon transistor, the core component of a computer chip. This particular one uses nanoscale manufacturing techniques to be incredibly small, and is at the heart of nanoelectronics, an important field of nanotechnology.","148":null,"149":"Not exactly. In trade, we exchange things that we have for things that we want. With blockchain, we can trade assets such as digital currencies securely and without need for a central authority like a bank, because it uses a digital ledger maintained by a network of computers.","150":"For a thing you like more, and we can use blockchain to make sure the trade is safe and secure","151":"To be honest, I've always thought it was a complex subject, but I've read a bit about it and it seems to be about exploiting system vulnerabilities, breaking into secured systems or networks, and gaining unauthorized access, right?","152":"So did you figure out how to hack the game, or what was the goal of rewiring the inputs and outputs?","153":"Sure. You can also consider the mouse, keyboard, network connections, and even stored files on the computer as inputs.","154":"Explainee: Yes, a camera is another input device. It captures images and transmits them to the computer.","155":"For hacking, you might use network inputs like IP addresses, ports, or protocols. Alternatively, you could manipulate application inputs like file paths, command line arguments, or user inputs such as passwords or cookies.","156":"It depends on many factors, such as the complexity of the system, the skill of the hacker, and the time they have to work on it. If it's a weakly protected system, it could take just a few minutes. For more complex systems, it might take days, weeks, or even months.","157":"Actually, it's not that simple. A rocket is propelled by its own engines, not just the slingshot effect. The engines produce a force strong enough to overcome gravity, propelling the rocket upward. Once it reaches escape velocity, gravity no longer pulls it back down and it enters orbit or continues into space.","158":"It is not pulled back by the gravity of the Earth because its speed keeps it going around the Earth due to the effect of inertia. Even though it is falling continuously, the centrifugal force keeps it in its orbit.","159":"you can feel it pulling you towards the center when it stops spinning suddenly.","160":"That's because your body is moving with the train. But it feels like you're standing still because the ground (or platform, or whatever you're standing on) around you is moving at the same speed. Gravity pulls you towards the ground, so if the ground is moving, your body moves with it to maintain contact with the ground.","161":"That's a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity, particularly its effects on gravity or the gravitational force between two objects. In the frame of reference of the moving train (you), gravity pulls the ball back towards you as if you were in your living room, regardless of the train's speed. From the outside, the ball would appear to move differently due to the relative motion of the train, but local measurements would show it behaving as expected. This phenomenon is called gravitational time dilation, where time can pass at different rates depending on the gravitational potential. It's both crazy and amazing to consider that these fundamental laws of physics shape our understanding of space and time.","162":"I've always wondered if we were truly heavier up there, but if we were, then we should feel lighter here on Earth because of the distance between us, right? But doesn't the centrifugal force that keeps us from falling off the Earth balance that out?","163":"Don't they? They're like the superheroes of the night!","164":"I see. Did you know that there's a science called sleep science that helps us understand why we feel tired or have a good sleep?","165":"And they can open and close their nostrils and ears to keep water out while they sleep.","166":"Why, you can even find out why that kid can sleep through a tornado!","167":null,"168":"They have two hemispheres in their brain. One hemisphere sleeps while the other one stays awake to keep them above water.","169":"Nanotechnology is the study, research, and application of extremely small things, called nanomaterials. These materials are measured in nanometers, where 1 nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Many things we use in our everyday life, like phones and clothes, could be made using nanotechnology in the future.","170":"And in nanotechnology, scientists can manipulate and rearrange these atoms to create new and unique materials.","171":"Because it can help us find cures for diseases, create faster computers, and even make our everyday objects better and longer-lasting.","172":"While VR can be immersive, it requires a high degree of computational power and precision to create the illusion of reality. It also suffers from tracking issues, latency, and comfort problems due to its confining nature and the weight of the hardware.","173":"Yes, you're right about audio. It's a cost-effective and powerful way to enhance immersion in virtual reality. However, the challenge is to create realistic, spatialized sounds that truly mimic the environment. Binaural audio is a step in that direction by using the specific ways sound waves reach our ears, but even that falls short when compared to the tactile feedback of touching objects in the virtual world. My pessimism about haptics is due to the difficulty in replicating the complex and nuanced sensation of touch. Until we manage to develop haptic feedback that's as sophisticated and responsive as human touch, I fear we'll remain limited in our ability to fully immerse users in the virtual world.","174":null,"175":"It's fascinating how we've been able to observe this force not just as a pulling force between objects, but also as a disturbance in spacetime, represented by gravitational waves. This discovery is a testament to the powerful interplay between classical and quantum mechanics that we hope will take us closer to understanding gravity at a fundamental level.","176":"But the interesting part is that despite the fact that gravity is stronger closer, the earth doesn't fall into the sun as it is constantly moving away due to centrifugal force.","177":"Then there's no difference between you and the elevator and the earth since all of you are equally affected by gravity. So that's when you feel weightless.","178":"So as you walk, you experience a force called gravity that pulls you down towards the earth, and your mass affects the strength of this force. Thus, the faster you walk, the more you are resisting this force, which is why you don't simply fall to the ground when you're walking.","179":"Because on Earth, the force of gravity pulls it towards the center.","180":" I've always wanted to learn about quantum gravity but it's a complex field. Can you suggest me some reading material or explain something in simple terms?","181":"When you jump from a tall building, you aren't really falling - you are being pulled toward the earth by gravity. So, in a strange sense, you feel lighter when you jump. You're just going back to where gravity wants you to be.","182":"Well, in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, for instance, we can use three axes\u2014x, y, and z\u2014to define the position of any point. Each axis represents a specific dimension, and coordinates assigned to these axes identify the point's location exactly. So a three-dimensional point would be something like (x, y, z), where x, y and z are the coordinates along the three axes.","183":"Yes, one of the reasons we consider the existence of extra dimensions in string theory is because, in string theory, particles are not points but tiny, one-dimensional strings. However, the mathematical structure that describes these strings requires them to live in a space with more dimensions than we're familiar with in our everyday life. Typically, string theory posits the existence of 10 dimensions, as opposed to the 4 spacetime dimensions and 3 spatial dimensions we experience.","184":"String theory provides the framework to address that gap by proposing that every fundamental particle in the universe is actually a tiny, vibrating string, not an indivisible point as in traditional quantum mechanics. Thus, it provides a unified theory that describes both quantum phenomena and gravity, making it an extension of the quantum mechanical framework to incorporate gravity.","185":"The idea of dimensions, as a mathematical concept, can be traced back to Euclid's Elements, where he defines space using three dimensions\u2014length, width, and depth. However, the idea has been generalized in modern mathematics to a higher number of dimensions as a way to model complex systems and structures.","186":"You can imagine a 2d surface made of these strings vibrating in a 3d space, and this is known as a membrane, or a 2-brane (pronounced as two-brane).","187":"Extra dimensions can provide additional room for the vibrations of these strings to interact and produce not just the vibrations we see, but also those with different frequencies. These different vibrations correspond to the different particles we observe in our universe, with their unique properties like mass and charge coming from the specific modes of vibration they exhibit.","188":"Yes, that's correct. String theory is often considered as one approach towards the Grand Unified Theory. It aims to unify the four fundamental interactions of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, into a single consistent framework.","189":"Also, string theory is unique because it suggests the existence of additional dimensions, which can help to explain some of the inconsistencies we see in physics. So, in a sense, string theory is trying to unify all known fundamental forces of nature while also introducing a new way of looking at space and time.","190":"A brane can be thought of as a membrane that exists in a higher dimensional space, where the number of dimensions it lives in is referred to as the brane's 'dimension'. The extra dimensions are the dimensions beyond the familiar three (length, width, height) that a brane could potentially move through or be confined to. Our universe could be a brane moving or vibrating within the multidimensional space.","191":null,"192":"As Valentinas said, it's not just people anymore. It's also machines and organizations that can be actors on the blockchain.","193":"Yeah, exactly. It's a relatively new technology, and its potential applications are vast. However, to facilitate mass adoption, we need to address key challenges such as scalability, security, and energy consumption. Additionally, there's a need for well-designed user interfaces that make it easy for average users to understand and interact with blockchain technology. Collaboration with various industries and governments for standardization and regulations will also play a significant role in its success.","194":null,"195":"I'm fascinated by your background in both math and origami! It's often said that origami, being an art form and also a form of mathematics, combines both creativity and logical reasoning. Can you tell me more about the mathematical aspects of origami that catch your interest?","196":"Yeah, exactly. The origami design is essentially a tube that gets inflated to form the wheel. This allows for a lightweight, space-saving design that can be easily carried and deployed as needed. The tubes are made from a flexible, lightweight material like Kapton foil, which is heat resistant and can withstand the harsh environments of space travel.","197":"Well, there's this new technology called Origami Robotics. It's essentially folding robots that can be deployed from a very compact form, and then they expand once they're in the environment to perform tasks such as search and rescue, or inspection of hard-to-reach areas. The potential applications are truly exciting, making it a promising breakthrough in robotics.","198":"A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers, making it secure, transparent, and resistant to data modification.","199":"Yes, precisely. By eliminating the need for a central authority to validate transactions, blockchain can disintermediate these middlemen, thereby reducing costs and increasing speed and efficiency of transactions.","200":"Yes, the blockchain system uses a decentralized network that allows multiple parties to validate and verify the identity, authenticity, and legitimacy of a transaction or seller. The network relies on consensus algorithms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which require the majority of the participating nodes to confirm the transaction before it is added to the blockchain, ensuring trust and security within the system.","201":"So, how have you been lately? I've been reading up on some recent sleep-related research, and I was wondering if you found any interesting results as well?","202":"It's interesting to note that this correlation doesn't just apply to sleep apnea. We've also observed significant associations with other sleep disorders. For instance, individuals experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness show a 2-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's, and those suffering from insomnia display a 3-fold increased risk.","203":"So it seems that both beta-amyloid and tauopathies are associated with sleep changes in the transgenic mouse models of AD. However, the relationship between sleep and beta-amyloid seems to be less clear compared to tauopathies. Some studies suggest that sleep disturbances might lead to increased beta-amyloid accumulation, but the causality is not confirmed yet.","204":"and I'd also like to highlight the recent advancements in understanding the role of sleep in memory consolidation, immune system regulation, and metabolic management. These discoveries have not only opened new avenues for research but also have significant implications for the development of interventions designed to improve cognitive functions, immune health, and even the prevention of metabolic disorders.","205":null,"206":"Yeah but that wouldn't be technically considered as one point of the origami since the point is supposed to be a folded shape, not a plane that we are cutting out from the sheet.","207":"As I drew a circle through the points of the crane's wings, I noticed that the circles are indeed visible in the crane pattern, demonstrating that the origami flap takes up a circular region of paper, as you explained.","208":"What design would you like to create? I can help you find a pattern or you can choose something new to create.","209":"Here's a simple explanation of nano technology: Nano technology involves manipulating matter on an atomic, molecular, or supramolecular scale. This is achieved by using techniques such as nanolithography, electroplating, and self-assembly to create materials with unique properties. For instance, nano materials can have higher strength, lower weight, and improved heat resistance compared to their bulk counterparts due to their structure at the nanoscale. These properties make them useful in various applications such as electronics, medicine, energy, and biotechnology.","210":"Your approach seems fascinating, using natural processes to synthesize complex nanostructures with high functionality for our technological needs. However, considering our current understanding, we're still far from teaching viruses to build solar cells, catalysts, or batteries. It would require significant advancements in molecular biology and nanotechnology to manipulate viruses in such a way. But your question does make us think, and it's worth exploration in the future.","211":"That sounds amazing! How do you select the protein sequence for the desired material synthesis? Do you have a design strategy or is it more of a trial-and-error process?","212":"I agree with you, and I see our work in the field of nanoscience contributing significantly towards that vision. We can develop technologies and materials at the nanoscale that are efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly. This could involve creating nano-engineered materials for batteries, solar cells, and catalysts, as well as developing strategies for their mass production while minimizing environmental impact. In a broader sense, I see the field moving towards a more interdisciplinary approach, integrating chemistry, materials science, engineering, and biology to tackle pressing challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity.","213":"Explainer: Origani is a brand known for its high-quality, organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and allergen-free superfoods, primarily sourced from Greece. The company's mission is to promote a healthier, happier, and greener world by offering nutrient-rich, sustainable, and eco-friendly products.","214":"They need to be designed in such a way that they can expand and be deployed once they are in zero gravity. This could involve intricate mechanical systems or even material technologies that expand when exposed to space conditions.","215":"So this asymmetry in motion can be explained by looking at the geometric properties of the origami structure. As the smaller angles approach 90 degrees, the larger angle fold undergoes a more profound change in shape compared to the smaller angle folds, causing it to move faster. However, closer to the fully-formed state, the roles reverse, and the larger angle fold approaches its final position more slowly while the smaller angle folds complete their motion quickly.","216":"Once up there, it springs open using the tension of the folding pattern for deployment.","217":"So, the only viable alternative is to maintain a controlled environment with similar growing conditions to simulate the same rate of growth and composition for larger Orobanchaceae plants.","218":"[If you are] Trying to maximize the area or packing density, you would prefer the origami that is more compact. But if you are designing something that needs to open at the same rate, you would prefer the one that opens slower.","219":"Sure, like in Minecraft, or in a Star Wars ship, or even in a real-life replica of a dinosaur's environment.","220":"It's because in a real world, if you move around the object, the object will also change relative to your position. In a 3D movie, you see the same pre-recorded video no matter where you are in the room. So, the change in perspective is a key difference between reality and a 3D movie.","221":"You might consider studying the Circle of Fifths, a fundamental concept in music theory that reveals the relationship among musical keys and their corresponding scales, chords, and key signatures. It is a circular diagram that organizes the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, each note being a fifth away (seven semitones) from its adjacent counterclockwise neighbor.","222":"So, you play the melody line first, then I'll add the chords to create the harmonic structure.","223":"In this version, we will use the Bb Major 7th chord. This gives us a bright and uplifting sound, and it pairs well with the melody we have.","224":"What is one thing about science that you like the most?","225":"Physics is a branch of science that focuses on understanding the interactions between matter and energy, as well as the properties and behavior of these. It involves studying concepts like dimensions, forces, energy, and time. Is there a specific area within physics that interests you?","226":"That's incorrect. Each dimension has its own distinct properties, and it doesn't necessarily mean that a three-dimensional object must have previously existed as a one- or two-dimensional object. A three-dimensional object can be created as it is without going through the process of existing in one or two dimensions first.","227":"You mean you would say 'I am at point A' or 'I am at the beginning of the line' since you're facing it.","228":" I understand. I'll explain the dimensions to you.","229":"An object in 3D space has length, height, and width, and in mathematics, we call these length, height, and width as dimensions.","230":null,"231":"Correct! Since you mentioned Gmail, let me give you an example based on that. There are ML models in Gmail that help it separate out your important emails from the spam. Over time, by processing millions of emails, Gmail learns to recognize patterns or features that distinguish spam from non-spam emails. These patterns can include the length of the subject line, use of specific words, or frequency of the sender's emails. As it learns more about each user, the accuracy of email filtering improves.","232":"Explainer: Exactly. And that's similar to what a machine learning model might do. It would look for patterns in the words used, the sender and recipient, and whether certain words or phrases are indicative of spam-like content. Some models might even look at images in emails or consider the time of day the email was sent to help make their decision.","233":"Yes, in a way, reinforcement learning has a trial-and-error approach. But it's not a kitchen sink approach because it follows a set mechanism for learning. It uses rewards and penalties to guide itself in improving its policy. Deep learning, on the other hand, focuses on automatically learning feature representations from large amounts of data.","234":"Absolutely, there are situations where deep learning might be preferred over reinforcement learning. For instance, when dealing with problems where a large amount of data is available, deep learning is more suitable as it can automatically learn to extract features from this data, whereas with reinforcement learning, we may need to manually design the state, action, and reward spaces. Additionally, deep learning excels in image and speech recognition tasks, whereas reinforcement learning is more commonly used for games and robotics where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to achieve a goal.","235":"Explainer: Yes, exactly! That's a great example. In that situation, the linear regression model provided predictions that might be accurate, but they didn't offer any insights into the factors contributing to customer churn. Consequently, the telecom company didn't know what actions to take to prevent or mitigate future churn, making the model less effective in achieving its purpose.","236":"We can improve machine learning algorithms by continually tuning and adjusting them based on feedback during training, considering various methods such as regularization, ensemble learning, and hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, gathering more diverse and high-quality data, addressing bias, and incorporating domain knowledge or feature engineering can enhance the performance of the algorithms.","237":"But even with this information, we would still be missing the dynamic aspect of the connectome, such as the synaptic plasticity, neural activity patterns, and temporal correlations, which are essential for understanding the brain's functioning.","238":"I'm a computer scientist. The brain's connectome is indeed extensive, but modern machine learning techniques and large-scale data analysis methods make it possible to model and understand such complex networks. While musical associations might play a role in a specific sub-network, they won't affect the overall modeling and understanding of the connectome as a whole.","239":"Well, the learning and skill development in music involves a complex interplay of the brain and the muscles. Muscles have their own memory, a concept known as muscle memory, which stores motor patterns through repetition and reinforcement. This allows for efficient and automatic execution of skillful movements. On the other hand, the brain, specifically the cortex, plays a crucial role in learning and coordinating these motor patterns through the formation of connections within the neural networks. These connections are dynamically strengthened and weakened during learning, a process that is crucial for skill development.","240":"I've been reading up on quantum entanglement and its potential for generating new, ultra-secure encryption methods. With that in mind, have you explored quantum cryptography and its applications in lasers?","241":"I couldn't ask for more, it was a stimulating experience.\nHowever, I yearn for fresh challenges and new horizons, making it difficult for me to stay.","242":"That's an interesting approach. However, I'm not sure if it's possible to beat the Schwinger limit by simply shining a laser onto an electron beam. The Schwinger limit is a theoretical limit that prevents the vacuum from spontaneously breaking down into electron-positron pairs due to the extreme energy density of the quantum field. To overcome this limit, you'd typically need to create extremely high-intensity fields, not just expose an electron beam to common laser light. Perhaps there's a specific scenario or technique I'm not aware of?","243":"Or we can do it the hard way, which is to do the derivations for the collisional particle accelerator in the lab frame, which is less efficient but more realistic.","244":"But achieving that with existing technology seems a bit far-fetched. Even if we could manage to increase the acceleration by a thousandfold, we'd still be far from reaching those speeds. That's where lasers come in, they could potentially provide the necessary push and propulsion to reach those speeds. It's a fascinating concept, but it's still largely theoretical.","245":"It's fascinating to see where we might take this technology in the future. For instance, the potential applications in industries like medicine, telecommunications, and astronomy are practically limitless. In medicine, lasers could revolutionize surgeries with greater precision and less invasive procedures. In telecommunications, we could potentially use lasers to transmit digital information at unimaginable speeds. As for astronomy, laser technology plays a crucial role in deep space exploration. For example, it's used in star wars, Lidar, and gravitational wave detectors. And who knows, maybe we'll even uncover previously unknown phenomena with lasers. After all, the possibilities are really only limited by human imagination.","246":"The hackers were able to gain unauthorized access to Target's database by exploiting a vulnerability in their HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system's remote access, which allowed them to install malware on the point-of-sale (POS) systems and steal payment card information.","247":"Yes, that's exactly the concept. Hackers exploit weak links in the network for easy access. In this case, the deli meat scale was probably not well-maintained or had not been updated with security patches, making it an attractive target for hackers.","248":"In other words, you'd essentially introduce a malicious payload to exploit a memory leak or buffer overflow, causing the program to crash.","249":"When it comes to network security, buffer overloading can be a critical vulnerability in a networked program, especially those that interact with users via a network interface. This is because an attacker can send malicious input that overflows the buffer, corrupting adjacent memory and potentially overwriting the return address, as I mentioned earlier. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system by making the processor jump to that address instead of the intended return address after the function completes. This process, known as a buffer overflow attack, is a common method for exploiting and gaining unauthorized access to systems. In terms of designing software for penetration testing, understanding buffer overflows is essential in identifying and fixing weaknesses before potential attackers can leverage them.","250":"So that's why I got into cybersecurity, as it provides an exciting means to apply my knowledge in global affairs by understanding and mitigating potential threats from nation-states. The rapidly evolving landscape of cyberspace requires constant learning and innovation, which I find both challenging and rewarding.","251":"I can also understand that we might need to know our adversaries' tactics so we can better protect our own data and systems. This is a complex issue, but it's clear that both sides, whether it's the state department funding tools to evade censorship or the NSA working to break those tools, have different priorities and perspectives.","252":"So what do you find interesting about them?","253":"If you have a cat, maybe you could use it. But please remember to never point it at your eyes or any sensitive areas.","254":"Lasers aren't just beams of light. They are focused and coherent light beams as well, which leads to their various applications.","255":"It helps us to see what's around the corner by illuminating the path, kind of like a Flashlight.","256":"It's much bigger than the width of our arm too.","257":"No, I haven't seen a laser before. ","258":"Is that the light from ruby laser? Ruby lasers have red light.","259":"That's very beautiful. But lasers can actually be used to simulate shooting stars. They can be used to create displays of light in the sky as well.","260":"So, are there any specific side channel analysis techniques you've considered applying to Rowhammer for future work?","261":"You could mitigate some risks by implementing security measures like setting up a firewall, changing the default router password, updating the router's firmware, and disabling unnecessary features.","262":"Just the kind of monopolistic behavior we shouldn't be encouraging. It's like they are trying to create an artificial barrier to entry for competition, making it harder for people or smaller companies to challenge their market dominance through reverse engineering. This goes against the spirit of innovation and the right to tinker.","263":"But I recently learned about blockchain and how it can help eBay and other platforms ensure even greater transparency and security.","264":"But with blockchain, some of those roles can be automated, significantly reducing the reliance on these middlemen.","265":"Let's imagine a digital ledger (a list of transactions), and each transaction is verified by a network of computers instead of a single intermediary. Once a transaction is verified and added to the ledger, it cannot be altered without being detected by the network. This creates a secure, transparent, and efficient system for recording transactions, which we call blockchain.","266":"You know how Bitcoin transactions are verified? In a decentralized manner through a technique called 'mining'. Miners compete to solve a complex mathematical problem, and whoever solves it first verifies the transaction, earns a reward, and adds it to the blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions.","267":"Ah, that sounds fascinating. So, you're interested in applying laser technology to biomedical engineering, right? In the realm of biomedical applications, lasers hold a significant place from diagnosis to treatment. For instance, lasers can be used to cut or incise tissues, coagulate them, or even for imaging purposes like fibroscopy. I wonder if you've ever considered potential projects using laser technology in your studies?","268":"Chirped pulse amplification (CPA) is a technique that stretches the duration of a high-powered laser pulse, amplifies it, and then rapidly compresses it back to its original duration. This technique allows for the production of high-intensity, ultra-short duration laser pulses. It's a crucial technology in various applications such as physics research, material processing, and even in medical procedures such as eye surgery.","269":null,"270":"We can use circle of fifths to understand the relationships between various notes. Each note in the circle is a fifth apart from its neighbor. So, C, G, D, A, E, B, F#, and C# are in the circle of fifths.","271":"And that's exactly what happens when a group of singers produce a perfect chord. The overtones generated from each singer combine to create additional tones that weren't intentionally produced by any one singer.","272":"I think one common approach to harmonization and reharmonization is trying to fit new notes or chords within the context of the existing melody. For example, we can choose chords that either emphasize or contrast with the existing melody. Additionally, we can also use chords from the chromatic scale, rather than just the diatonic scale, to add dissonance or tension. This is a popular technique in jazz and modern music, where the tension created by dissonance is often resolved to create a sense of release and resolution.","273":null,"274":"And this is the interval of a perfect 5th above F.","275":"There are also cases where you could use dissonance to express tension or conflict in your compositions, which are important elements in the concept of negative harmony. This can involve using intervals like the tritone, or dissonant chords like the augmented sixth, which can create a sense of unease or unresolved tension.","276":"Right, but by changing the melody and the chord pattern, you've given the song a melancholic feel, contradicting the traditional implications of a major key, thus leading to confusion or even sadness, not happiness, as a child might perceive initially.","277":"You have moved to a relative minor key, which can create a sense of tension and sadness. In this case, F major is the relative minor of A major.","278":"but our connectome, the pattern of connections in our brain, could be mapped and that data could potentially be uploaded into a computer, however, even if the computer replicated our connectome exactly, it would not have consciousness, feelings, or self-awareness like humans do, which are crucial aspects of what makes individuals unique and gives meaning to their lives.","279":"That's where the concept of the connectome comes in. Connectome is the complete map and structural organization of the neural connections in the brain. This could potentially provide a complete understanding of the brain's function.","280":"But the whole 'you' is intricately linked and structured through the connections among those neurons - this is what we call a 'connectome'. If we could map that out, we might truly understand consciousness and personality.","281":"And it's used in cryptography for maintaining privacy, such as in blockchain technology and password managers, to ensure users' data remains secure while still allowing transactions to occur.","282":"Exactly. In a zero-knowledge proof, you can prove that you know a secret (like a password or private key), without revealing any information about the secret itself.","283":"But you don't trust them; they might snoop on your messages. What you can do is use a zero-knowledge proof. You can ask a trusted third party, like a bank, to verify your identity. Then, you can send your message to the third party without revealing the content. The third party can confirm that the message is indeed from you without knowing what the message says. After they confirm your identity, you can receive the message from them, but the third party never knows the content of the message. This way, even if the third party decides to snoop on the message, they can only confirm the identity of the sender without gaining any information about the message itself.","284":"Because we are using the concept of 'mathematical truth'. We prove something is true without revealing what we know or have.","285":"Student: And how does the brain store memories over such a long period of time?","286":"That experience definitely shaped my interest in science, particularly in biology and oncology. It made me realize the power of science in solving real-world problems and sparked my passion for understanding and potentially fighting against diseases like cancer.","287":"One thing I really like is zero-knowledge proofs, a way to prove you know a secret without revealing the secret itself! Isn't that cool?","288":"But I can show you a secret that will prove I know without telling you. This is called zero-knowledge proof.","289":"[Assuming the hole was a camera hole, we might say something like]: 'I did not show you the photo directly, but you were still able to see the puffin - this demonstrates the principle of zero-knowledge proof. I did not reveal to you where the puffin was, but I provided enough information to prove its existence.'","290":"But with zero-knowledge proofs, you can prove to the hacker that you know the password without actually telling them what it is.","291":"That's exactly what zero-knowledge proofs enable you to do. They allow you to prove that you know a secret without actually revealing the secret.","292":null,"293":"The new guest can take room number 1 since the rest of the guests have already been shifted.","294":"Yes, that's correct. Two plus infinity is still infinity.","295":"Unfortunately not, because our hotel is already full and we have guests there too. So we need to find another accommodation for them.","296":"Yes, that's right. Moving guests to higher rooms creates new spaces. Moving the next person would be from room 4 to room 6, then from room 6 to room 8, and it continues in that pattern.","297":"Infinity twice","298":"For me, infinity is a fascinating concept that mathematics has been grappling with for centuries. It challenges our understanding of the world and forces us to reconsider what we thought we knew. In mathematics, we use infinity to solve problems that seem impossible with finite numbers. For example, Hilbert's Hotel is a paradox that demonstrates the absurdities that can come from naively applying arithmetic rules to infinity. It's a fun thought experiment that highlights the need for careful consideration when working with such abstract ideas.","299":"It's a theory named after philosopher Hans Moravec. He proposed that in the future, artificial intelligence will be able to perform tasks that require human-level intelligence, such as understanding and manipulating the environment, but will forever struggle with tasks that are easier for young children, like recognizing faces or voices, or even understanding jokes. This implies that AI will be able to surpass human intelligence in some ways, but will always be limited in its abilities compared to human cognitive development.","300":"That's not necessarily the case. It's more about understanding and applying abstract concepts. A robot might be able to move with precision, but understanding complex tasks like cooking, playing a musical instrument, or even basic communication can be much more challenging due to the abstract and nuanced nature of these tasks.","301":"The problem isn't necessarily collecting data, but the quality and quantity of the data we have for these basic tasks.

The hippocampus and amyggdaloid complex, specifically, are responsible for the formation and recall of memories, which then transfer to the neocortex for long-term storage.

In contrast, quantum sensing requires detecting the minute changes in a quantum system's state, which is much more sensitive and challenging because it involves the quantum mechanical properties of individual particles like electrons or spins.","340":"For instance, maintaining the coherence of the quantum states can be difficult due to interactions with the noisy environment and the need for precise control over the system. Also, scaling up to larger systems can present challenges, as each additional atom or photon increases the complexity of keeping coherence and control over the system.","341":null,"342":"I guess we need to think about implementing filters to block out these unwanted signals.

Classical computing doesn't face this issue as reliability is assured by repetition and error correction techniques that don't disturb the state of the system.","349":"The reason for this is that every qubit you add increases the chances of decoherence, which can potentially erase the quantum state of the entire system.","350":"Explainee: Right now, the primary challenge is to build a quantum computer that can maintain its quantum state for a sufficiently long period. This is critical for quantum algorithms to be executed effectively. As of now, we can only achieve this for a few milliseconds at best.

In quantum sensing, we are indeed focusing on interacting with quantum systems to detect subtle changes and measure small quantities, such as magnetic fields or time intervals, much more precisely than classical sensors can. This is achieved by utilizing the unique properties of quantum systems, like superposition and entanglement. For example, in a process called quantum magnetometry, we use superconducting qubits to measure magnetic fields that are too weak to be detected with classical sensors.","361":"I'm researching quantum sensing. It's a field that focuses on using quantum physics principles to precisely detect and measure physical properties such as magnetic fields, electrical current, or even the position of particles.

The process of finding a diamond with the right kind of defect is time-consuming and requires a lot of testing.","364":"Quantum computing makes use of the concept of superposition, where a quantum bit can exist in two states at once, like spin up and spin down. This property can be utilized in a nitrogen-vacancy center. For example, you can have the vacancy trapped in one of two states, and you can measure it and it will always be found in one of these states. However, if you don't measure it, and you keep it in a superposition, then every possible state that the nitrogen-vacancy can be in is simultaneously present.","365":"Yeah, sort of like a quantum sensor would use the instability of the superposition states in a quantum system to detect and measure changes in its environment.","366":"Yes, an atomic clock is a type of quantum sensor. It uses the quantum vibrations, or energy states, of atoms to measure time.","367":"So how do you see the internet affecting your learning?","368":"Well, on a smaller scale, every device in your house is connected to a local network through a router, which is like an electronic intersection. And these local networks then connect to the city's main network, often through some sort of wide area network (WAN) like cable or DSL. City networks, in turn, are interconnected on larger scales, all the way up to the internet backbone, which is the main highway system for data transmission.","369":"That's because the internet is not just one big network, but many smaller networks interconnected through various routing techniques. Each device that connects to the internet has a unique network address, IP address. When you initiate a call to Australia, the call is broken down into small packets, each with the sender's IP address, receiver's IP address, and the necessary data. These packets travel through the network, being sent from router to router, until they reach their destination. The routers are like post offices, where packets arrive, get sorted, and are sent to the next router on the path to their destination. This way, the internet can send thousands of packets at the same time, using multiple paths, to ensure messages reach their destination quickly and efficiently.","370":"Yes, there are several underseas cables connecting different countries and continents","371":"Wireless communication is done through satellites and wireless network devices such as routers and Wi-Fi hotspots.

Instead, your device sends a request for the file to one of the many servers that are part of the content delivery network. These servers are spread out geographically, often internationally, so that no single server has to bear the load of distributing the content to everyone. Once a server receives your request, it sends the file to you, and if it doesn't have the file on its own server, it might ask another server in the network for it. This way, the content delivery network ensures that lots of people can download the same content quickly and efficiently.","373":"Well, when you request to watch Vampire Diaries on Netflix, your device sends a message to a server, asking it to send the specific video files.

This aligns with my vision of not wanting a large increase in complexity proportional to the number of devices.","397":"I think you're correct that such sensors typically generate very little data. But let's not compare apples to oranges. How about we discuss the typical data rates for a Wi-Fi-connected smart LED bulb that could be sending color and brightness information, or a smartwatch sending heart rate data every few seconds? These would be in the range of kilobytes per second.","398":"By collaborating with the right people, we could access these distributed sensor data, and conduct a comparative study on the acoustic landscape of New York City, taking into consideration the daily rush hour traffic. This could help identify streets with higher than required noise levels, thereby facilitating necessary interventions.","399":"Knowledge is essentially structured data, in a person's mind, that may have been gained through experience or learning. A zero-knowledge proof system involves transmitting information between parties, but neither party learns anything about the underlying data (beyond the fact it exists). So, while there is information being transmitted, it's not exactly 'data'. Hence, it's zero-data.","400":"So, that means it should be possible to prove the possession of a secret without revealing the secret itself, right?","401":"Knowledge of the data is not the same as knowing how to access the data or what the data is. In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover demonstrates knowledge of the data without revealing any information about the data itself.","402":"In the context of zero-knowledge proofs, it is about allowing a prover to show that it knows a value, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For instance, in a blockchain or a distributed ledger, a zero-knowledge proof can be used to verify a transaction without revealing the details of the transaction like the sender's and recipient's identities or the transaction amount.","403":"Well, the future directions for zero-knowledge proofs are quite fascinating. In the realm of cryptography, we're already seeing ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKS being used in various blockchain applications, such as privacy-preserving smart contracts and decentralized identities. As for the mathematical computations, we're constantly pushing the boundaries of the complexity theory to find new ways to optimize ZKP solutions. In the real world, we anticipate ZKPs becoming integral to data privacy and, perhaps, even security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring secure data sharing among heterogeneous systems without revealing sensitive information.","404":"From what I know, the Large Magellanic Cloud does not have a huge black hole that we have definitively detected. However, some models suggest a small supermassive black hole might exist at its center, but it's not yet confirmed with enough evidence.","405":"But some theories suggest they may have massive companion stars orbiting them due to the strong force of gravity, which might prevent the black hole from growing.","406":"I see. But that is just one of the many theories. Another fascinating theory is the Hawking radiation which suggests black holes aren't completely black and can lose mass. This could potentially lead to their eventual evaporation.","407":"They attract each other","408":"Right, if our black holes' velocities are not too different from each other's when they meet, they will merge and the resulting black hole will be even bigger. This could produce gravitational waves and lead to interesting phenomena such as increased tidal forces on nearby stars.","409":"However, with a quantum computer, we could theoretically accomplish faster training times as quantum computing can perform multiple calculations at once.","410":" I've seen research proposals that focus on using quantum computing for optimization algorithms, such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms can potentially provide exponential speedups for some specific instances of the problem. By reducing the time needed to optimize complex systems, machine learning models can train faster and improve performance on various tasks.","411":"In a quantum computer, you don't have classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, but quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in a state of 0, 1, or even a superposition of both states simultaneously. This superposition is what allows a quantum computer to perform multiple calculations at once, thanks to a principle called superposition. Quantum logic gates, such as the famous quantum version of 'AND' called a CNOT gate, operate on these qubits, manipulating their states differently than classical gates do.","412":"Well, in a quantum computer, we use a system of qubits to represent the bits. Each qubit can be in a state of 0 or 1, but also in a superposition of both states simultaneously. To initialize the system, we set all the qubits to a specific state, often a combination of 0's and 1's that represents the initial state of our problem.","413":"So we need to design algorithms that have a high probability of producing the correct answer, even though the intermediate steps might be probabilistic.","414":"they are called error-correcting codes and noise-aware algorithms, and we are developing them to deal with the errors and imperfections of near-term quantum computers.","415":"But the problem is we don't quite know what other problems can be effectively solved yet, because we lack a universal quantum computer. It's challenging to predict how well a quantum computer can handle other problems until we have one.","416":"I've also found that it's beneficial to design tasks that mimic real-world scenarios for the robot. This can help the robot to learn more effectively and transfer its skills to real-world applications. Additionally, providing the robot with a prior understanding of its environment can significantly reduce the amount of trial and error it needs to learn effectively.","417":null,"418":null,"419":"Firstly, you will need to open up a programming language like Python or JavaScript, and write a series of calculations and commands. Then, using a library specifically for fractals such as 'matplotlib' in Python, you can instruct the computer to create and display a fractal.","420":"I've been thinking a lot about the future of the internet recently. Did you catch the recent article on AI and the internet?","421":"But as the number of access network hops is getting reduced, it's making it possible to have software-defined networking more end-to-end, at least within the context of a single session, if not the entire internet. However, the challenge remains in managing the complexity and interoperability of software-defined networking across different providers.","422":"Also, since there's no global body regulating the internet, these actions aren't necessarily preventable. However, it's important to note that the usage of VPNs and similar technology can help mask a user's location and circumvent these restrictions.","423":"For example, I can infer the type of device a user is using based on the screen size of the website, or I can guess the user's language preference based on the locale settings of their browser.","424":"Explainee: That's where the challenge lies - balancing latency, reliability, and security to create an environment that's both dependable and efficient, ensuring smooth data transmission without compromising the integrity of the information.","425":"It's also about better energy efficiency which allows for a larger number of connected devices, and it's about enabling different types of use-cases, like IoT, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality applications.","426":"Well, what is a black hole exactly?","427":" So it's a fascinating object to study because we're still learning about what happens to this matter that leaves the event horizon. Some scientists believe that when you get close enough to the singularity \u2013 that infinitely dense point at the center of the black hole \u2013 the laws of physics as we know them break down. There are some theories that propose matter is torn apart at the atomic level when it gets too close, and others say it gets stretched out infinitely into something known as a 'wormhole'.","428":" A Schwarzschild black hole is static and non-rotating, while a Kerr black hole rotates around its axis. The rotation of a black hole depends on the angular momentum of the matter that collapses to form the black hole. If the matter has angular momentum before it collapses, it forms a rotating black hole. On the other hand, if the matter has zero angular momentum, it forms a static black hole. In the universe, rotating black holes are more common as most stars have some sort of rotation.","429":"So if we understand the right quantum gravity theory to describe both gravity and quantum mechanics, it's possible to resolve the singularity by showing that the quantum corrections would prevent the spacetime from ever contracting infinitely and reaching a single point. In other words, we would predict that the singularity doesn't exist in reality.","430":"Explainer: Yes, we cannot observe or measure directly what happens as you cross the event horizon or what occurs within a black hole. Instead, we infer these phenomena based on theoretical models, general relativity, and the behavior of matter close to the black hole.","431":"He proposed the theory of Hawking radiation, which states that pairs of virtual particles (one positive and one negative) get created near the event horizon of a black hole. Normally, these particles get annihilated, but in this case, if one falls into the black hole, the other escapes, resulting in the loss of mass and energy from the black hole, essentially emitting radiation.","432":"What we're discovering through studying black holes, is that they might be the key to unifying general relativity (gravity) with quantum mechanics, which would finally give us a theory of quantum gravity. As black holes are the result of colossal matter concentrations, they force us to confront the limitations of our current understanding of gravity at extraordinarily high densities, pushing us to explore new theories like loop quantum gravity or string theory.","433":"Right! In essence, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a special type of proof where the prover can demonstrate to the verifier that they know a specific value, or possess a certain property, without revealing any information beyond the fact that they know it. It's a powerful tool for ensuring privacy in sensitive computations.","434":null,"435":"But the challenge lies in ensuring privacy and security for sensitive data uploaded to the cloud, which is a significant concern when using zero-knowledge proofs.","436":"Explainee: And if you then go back to that place where the orange juice wasn't very good, but now you might remember that delicious vacation with a refreshing glass of orange juice, and it would make you view the orange juice from that place in a different light.","437":"That's right, and the uncertainty and the doubt about the decision might lead to increased activity in the parts of the brain associated with memory recall, as trying to figure out whether you made the right decision or not might trigger your brain to remember more information or details about the options you were considering, in order to assess whether you made the correct choice.","438":"Oh, that's a great choice! I love the part where Matilda teaches Miss Honey to read. It shows that knowledge and education can change people's lives.","439":"and to the destination, hence completing the network route for transferring the video.","440":"Actually, that's a good question. Routing is necessary to find the most efficient path for the data to travel, taking into account factors such as network congestion, distance, and available resources. This way, the data can take the quickest and most reliable route to get to its destination.","441":"This also helps in load balancing, making the internet traffic distributed and reducing congestion in any particular path. It ensures faster and more efficient data transfer.","442":"... I am, your friend on the internet who sends you fun and educational texts.","443":null,"444":"Explainee: Yeah, it's like how our brain, in a way, simulates the past. It doesn't keep every tiny detail from all the experiences, instead, it recalls the core elements and fills in the rest based on the stored models. So, it's creating a similar experience as if it's recalling the actual memory.","445":"Black holes are so massive that they warp space and time around them. This creates a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe and help us to understand the evolution of the cosmos.","446":"It's believed to be a black hole due to several reasons. Firstly, the frequency and the particular pattern of the waves are consistent with those produced by the collision of two black holes. Secondly, black holes are the only known objects with enough mass and density to produce gravitational waves that we can detect with LIGO. Lastly, the data is also used to calculate the mass and the spin of the colliding black holes, and these values also fit what we expect for black holes.","447":"When a black hole merges with another black hole or collides with another massive object, it creates gravitational waves. These waves ripple through the fabric of spacetime. Here on Earth, these waves are measured by sensitive instruments such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo Observatory. These observatories can measure the minute changes in length created by the disturbance in the fabric of spacetime caused by the gravitational waves. This is how scientists are able to detect the presence of black holes and study their behavior.","448":"As you may know, I have been working on Moravec's paradox lately and wanted to discuss it with you.","449":"I agree with you on the concept of promiscuous generalization about agents. However, Moravec's Paradox suggests that while high-level tasks may be difficult for robots, low-level tasks, like complex physical manipulations, come easier. It's precisely this mismatch between our expectations and reality that makes it challenging to design intelligent agents. So, perhaps we should be working on developing robots that are capable of low-level physical tasks before trying to tackle high-level cognition, in an attempt to avoid promiscuous generalization.","450":"Interesting! How does memory influence these perceptions and judgements?","451":"It's interesting how memory intertwines with those aspects, shaping and being shaped by our perceptions and social judgments. Could we explore some examples of this intersection in more detail?","452":"Those are indeed very interesting points you made. I think it's also crucial to consider the role of personal experiences and associations in shaping our emotional responses. For instance, one person might associate a certain scent with a happy childhood memory, while another person might associate it with an unpleasant experience. Our emotions and memories are deeply interconnected and personal, which makes our emotional reactions to similar stimuli quite diverse.","453":"Right, and the way I've been thinking about it recently is that sometimes these emotional responses, or at least the way we remember them, can be greatly influenced by the social or cultural context in which we experience them, and that can lead to interesting biases or discrepancies in how we interpret our memories.","454":null,"455":"Type a command for the robot to perform a multiplication of a two-digit number.","456":"I don't think I can do it with my eyes closed. With my eyes open, I can see the patterns and guess where I need to go. I'm not sure if I can mimic the actions without that visual input.","457":"...And that's why a child knows to pick it up off the ground, yet can't understand the complexities of quantum physics when told. This is Moravec's Paradox.","458":"Well, not in the same way as humans do. They don't have the same emotional or self-awareness responses, so they don't 'know' they messed up in the same sense humans do. However, a well-designed robot can recognize when it has made an error in its programmed tasks and adjust accordingly.","459":"Robots don't have feelings, desires, beliefs, or consciousness, so they cannot go off the program in the sense that humans might. Their 'decisions' are based on their programming and the input they receive.","460":"Not necessarily, as robots don't have the capability to make decisions on their own or have their own consciousness. They can only follow their programs and perform the tasks for which they were designed.","461":"That's fascinating! It's amazing how accessible fractals have become with the help of technology. Even kids can create captivating fractal patterns with minimal effort.","462":null,"463":"That's exactly what happens with fractals, specifically the Mandelbrot set. You're generating self-similar patterns by iteratively applying a simple equation to a set of values. It's remarkable how similar that process is to physical phenomena, such as turbulence in fluids.","464":"You derive equations for different types of fractals, and by solving those equations numerically, you can generate amazing visual patterns that exhibit self-similarity and infinite complexity.","465":"And fractals are a set of repeat patterns that repeat at differing scales to make use of simplicity and scaling principles.","466":"Scaling, while simple, is a step. However, we need to consider how to make these landscapes more immersive and interactive. Maybe by adding elements that mimic real-world systems, such as weather, wild and diverse fauna, and dynamic geographical features could add that richness and companionship that you're talking about.","467":"you can't store an entire world in a computer, but you can create self-similar patterns and intricate detail through the use of fractal geometry to represent certain aspects of the world, such as the branching of a tree or coastlines, since these structures often have a repeating pattern of branches or curves that can be described mathematically.","468":"He made those happy little trees by focusing on simplifying the process and incorporating fractal algorithms to automate the creation of tree-like structures with great visual depth and detail.","469":"If it's all finite numbers you can see inside the collection, then it should be a countable infinite set, as the number of integers is infinite but each integer is discernible and can be enumerated one by one.","470":null,"471":null,"472":null,"473":"This penny can be in any state, both heads and tails, at the same time.

It's basically a scanning method used in medicine to visualize the internal structure of body tissues. Now, quantum sensing is quite similar, but instead of using magnetic fields, it uses quantum mechanical phenomena to sense things. For example, it can detect tiny magnetic fields or small changes in electric fields that are too small for classical sensors to detect. This has potential applications in areas like biology and geophysics.","478":null,"479":"Yes, there are several quantum sensors in the developmental stage, such as quantum microscopes, quantum magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) devices, and quantum clocks. Quantum microscopes can potentially offer significant advantages over classical microscopes in terms of resolution and sensitivity. qMRI devices could potentially provide higher resolution and sensitivity than classical MRI scanners.

On the other hand, modafinil, though it acts on dopamine, is specifically designed as a wake-promoting agent for individuals who suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness. Modafinil is less likely to interfere with sleep quality compared to amphetamines, as it selectively targets wake-promoting areas in the brain without significantly affecting dopamine reuptake, thus its use is generally more controlled and less risky.","3":null,"4":"Explainer: In terms of Western music theory, a major triad is constructed by stacking three major third intervals, with the foundation note at the lowest position, followed by a note above it that is a major third, and finally another note a major third higher than the second one.","5":"The key is to trust your instincts. They guide you towards the harmony that resonates with you, which is what makes your music unique.","6":null,"7":null,"8":"It turns out that the haunting melody I encountered was built on an augmented 6th chord.","9":"When we speak of inversion in the context of piano playing, it refers to rearranging the intervals within a chord. For example, with a C major chord (C, E, G), in first inversion, the C is placed in the bass, the E takes the middle, and the G is elevated to the top, forming a G major chord (G, B, C). In the second inversion, the E moves to the bass, the C resides in the middle, and the G is at the top, producing a C major chord (C, G, B).","10":null,"11":"Indeed, Amazing Grace is a widely recognized hymn with a remarkable significance.

This new data would help us delve deeper into the mysteries of neutron stars, which are among the most fascinating and extreme astrophysical objects we know of.","22":null,"23":"Explainer: As a theoretical physicist, you could delve into areas such as string theory, quantum mechanics, or cosmology to investigate the strange and exciting properties of dimensions that extend beyond the three we're accustomed to in our everyday experiences.","24":"So it's fascinating, we're moving through four spatial dimensions: length, width, height, and time in the space-time continuum. However, unlike those dimensions, we don't experience a tactile or 'touch' dimension in the same way, even though we can comprehend it conceptually.","25":"To put it simply, Einstein's theory of relativity introduced the concept of the fabric of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional space-time continuum encompassing three dimensions of space and one of time. His field equations express how this fabric bends under the influence of energy and matter, affecting movement and the passage of events. This curvature allows us to understand how massive objects like planets and stars alter the flow of time and space. Essentially, the structure of spacetime is molded by matter and energy, which is the essence of Einstein's relativity and the explanation behind gravity as a curvature in the fabric of spacetime.","26":"That's a great question! In relativity, space and time are indeed intertwined, forming a single, four-dimensional entity known as spacetime. The idea is that as an object moves along the timeline, it simultaneously moves through space. The distance between events can change based on the relative motion of the observers. This concept is essential for understanding how time can seem to dilate or contract depending on velocity.","27":"In the context of special relativity, spacetime is a four-dimensional space-time continuum, where the additional dimension, 'time', replaces Z. Imagine a two-dimensional space where the path's length between two points can depend on the observer's speed and the path's curvature. This is similar to spacetime. It's essential to consider spacetime as a fundamental aspect of our physical reality since the 'distance' or 'interval' between two points can now be affected by these factors.","28":"So if you're a little person and you started some event, you'd be located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three dimensions of space, and you're moving through space-time due to aging. Now, imagine placing a flag at the exact spot where you started, and pausing the whole universe at that moment. That specific spot, that moment, that flag would represent a single point - or an event - in 4D spacetime. This point has three spatial dimensions (based on your current position in space) and one time dimension (from when the event took place). So, a single event in space-time has four dimensions - three spatial and one temporal.","29":"I'm illustrating that, while you can move through space and have the illusion of traveling through time, say, by riding a rocket ship, the time continues to progress for the stationary observer. In essence, I 'traveled' 24 hours into the future simply by remaining here. Time's passage is an intrinsic element of spacetime travel, not just a byproduct of a specific motion.","30":"Yes, exactly. Proper time is a measure of time experienced by an observer in a gravitational field, taking into account the curvature of spacetime. It's a fundamental time measure that accounts for the warping effects of mass and energy.","31":null,"32":"That's quite interesting! The person who sat in the chair might have perceived time differently because they were confined to a smaller physical space. On the other hand, the person who zoomed out could have experienced time differently too, due to the effects of moving at high speeds, which, according to special relativity, can make time seem to pass more slowly.","33":null,"34":"Yes, you can think of it that way. If you had a flat tablecloth and placed a heavy book on it, the cloth would sag around the book, representing the gravitational pull. Similarly, in space, the more massive an object (like a planet or a star), the greater the 'dent' or curvature it creates in spacetime. This 'dent' is what we perceive as gravity.","35":null,"36":"Have you ever found that melody can help evoke specific emotions in a piece of work or a situation?","37":"I'm really appreciative that you're enjoying it so far. Let's pick up where we left off later and make even more improvements to it.","38":"Imagine this: instead of trying to pack a big piece of paper, you're only working with a tube-like section. Now, picture rolling up that tube. There's a chance for it to spontaneously shrink, like how water transforms from a liquid into a solid when it freezes, through a phase transition.","39":"To answer your question, we randomly initialize the dimensions within a specified range. During the learning process, the dimensions evolve based on the interactions and dynamics of the system. This allows for an adaptable and responsive model.","40":"Black branes, unlike black holes, are not material objects. Instead, they represent hypothetical extended objects within the context of string theory, defined by the number of dimensions they occupy. String vibrations throughout these dimensions give rise to the particles we observe in our universe.","41":"Indeed, our discussion leads to a model of a universe with a specific intriguing balance. The electromagnetic field and cosmological constant counteract each other, keeping a multidimensional sphere fixed at a certain distance from a point singularity. Meanwhile, the other dimensions asymptote to a constant radius, stretching out infinitely in all directions.","42":null,"43":null,"44":"Gravity is what keeps objects, including us, on the Earth. Black holes, on the other hand, are regions in space where gravity is extremely strong, and even light can't escape. Since they don't help maintain the Earth's gravitational pull, they don't contribute to keeping us here.","45":"Could you please visualize me waving my hand in front of the person you are observing?","46":null,"47":" Yes, I can certainly provide some general information about lasers. They are highly directional beams of concentrated light that are produced by a process called stimulated emission.

If you're more interested in the specific laser you use, feel free to share its type or purpose and I'd be happy to help with that too! ","48":"The main difference between a continuous wave laser running at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier lies in the delivery of power. While the continuous wave laser provides power at a steady rate, a chirped pulse amplifier concentrates that power into very short, intense bursts. This is achieved by prolonging the pulse, amplifying it, and subsequently compressing it to a shorter duration, allowing for a rapid and concentrated energy release.","49":"There are ongoing research and development efforts to push the limits even further. As of now, the most powerful laser system, the National Ignition Facility (NIF), generates petawatt (PW) level energy, which is about 1015 watts. Some theoretical designs propose the idea of exawatt (EW) lasers, or approximately 1018 watts, but they are currently impractical and beyond our reach.","50":"Perhaps we could use a focused ultrasound, combined with microbubbles, to target and disrupt the tumor cell while minimizing harm to healthy neighboring cells. The ultrasound concentrates energy at the microbubbles' location, creating small cavitation bubbles that expand and collapse, generating pressure waves that can selectively destroy the tumor cell.","51":"Your insights about Life of Us are fascinating and I couldn't agree more. Embracing a low-poly aesthetic and the co-presence of other creatures allows for a unique immersion that can put us at ease and makes the VR experience more compelling. This approach has the potential to be applied to other VR projects as well, reminding us that sometimes simplicity can create a greater immersion.","52":"That's an interesting point about the limitations with Moore's Law.

Speaking of which, have you considered pursuing a career that involves both biology and computer science, perhaps in bioinformatics or genetic engineering? There's a fascinating intersection between the two!","56":"Absolutely! To put it simply, dimensions are how we measure size or extent in various directions. For instance, length, width, and height describe a three-dimensional object in our space. However, there's not a hard limit to the number of dimensions. Concepts like the fourth dimension, often used to represent time, or even higher dimensions, are part of the discussion in various scientific theories. If you have any specific questions or would like elaborate on certain aspects, feel free to ask!","57":"Now, visualize adding a third line perpendicular to the first two. You've got your three dimensions.","58":"Interestingly enough, not only do we use the XY plane, but there's a coordinate system called XYZ, wherein the Z-axis orthogonally encompasses the XY plane. This helps us represent the third dimension, such as height or depth.","59":"Could we also specify the distance from the center and the angle our line makes with the X-axis? This would give us a clearer picture of our location.","60":"So, just like on Earth, the Right Ascension (or RA) acts like longitude, marking the east-west position of a celestial body. Meanwhile, the Declination (or Dec) performs a similar role to latitude, indicating the north-south position.","61":null,"62":null,"63":"In our current understanding, we're still working on forming a quantum theory of gravity, which would help us better understand and describe the dimensions in our universe. This is a challenge since gravity isn't fully accounted for in the standard model.","64":"The Event Horizon Telescope project is an international collaboration that uses a network of radio telescopes strategically placed around the globe to create a single, powerful telescope. This allows scientists to study black holes indirectly, as they do not emit or reflect light. By observing the effects of black holes' immense gravitational pull on nearby stars and gas, they can gather valuable data. In particular, the project aims to capture direct images of the black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, which would provide unprecedented insights into these cosmic objects.","65":"Gravity's force pulls us towards Earth, preventing us from floating away.","66":"Specifically, the Moon's gravitational force causes the Earth to rotate slightly faster, a phenomenon called tidal acceleration. This uneven spinning leads to higher and lower water levels along the Earth's coast, creating the tides.","67":"Actually, if gravity was much stronger, we would be unable to exert enough force to counteract it and lift ourselves off the ground. We are constantly battling gravity to stay upright, which is why we can walk or stand in the first place.","68":"I'd estimate you're around 4 feet tall.","69":null,"70":"It's fascinating how Galileo observed gravity in action by studying falling objects, discovering that they fall at a constant velocity regardless of their mass. Later, Newton built upon this work, formalizing the concept of gravity as the force that attracts any two objects with mass towards each other. ","71":"Well, gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other, depending on their masses and the distance between them. Given Earth's much larger mass compared to things on its surface, it pulls everything near to its center. This explains why apples fall from trees, and objects generally fall to the ground here on Earth.","72":"Did you know that a heavy object falls faster than a light one due to a concept called gravity? Isn't physics fascinating?","73":"That's interesting! However, remember that everyone's sleep needs can vary. If you're still feeling tired after six hours, it might be a sign that you need more. Additionally, factors like stress, diet, and sleep quality can also impact the quantity of sleep you need.

For example, stress or anxiety can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle, resulting in less sleep. Additionally, certain health conditions, like sleep apnea or chronic pain, can influence the amount of sleep required.","75":"Yes, exactly. Your environment with long days can affect your sleep patterns, especially if you have early sunrises and late sunsets. This can make it more challenging for your body to adapt to a regular sleep-wake cycle. To combat this, it's important to expose yourself to bright sunlight during the day, which can help synchronize your internal clock with the external environment's cues to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Additionally, adjusting your sleep schedule to better align with the light-dark cycle may help improve your sleep quality.","76":"Yes, it's a beam of light. However, it's unique because it's concentrated and has a specific wavelength, unlike the light from a light bulb. This particularity is what makes lasers capable of carrying information and performing precise tasks like cutting or welding materials.","77":"Explainee: The force of impact is more concentrated at the smaller surface area of the sharp end, allowing it to penetrate more easily into the piece of wood, as the energy is distributed across a smaller area.","78":null,"79":"so if we pulse the laser, we can create a high-power, intense light for a very short period of time, concentrating the energy in a small area.","80":"That's correct! With the funnel, the light will be concentrated even more effectively using the lens.","81":null,"82":"It's interesting to consider that sleep is not just a bodily rest, but a essential process through which our brains consolidate, process, and store memories. Our sleep habits can significantly impact our cognitive function and emotional well-being.","83":"Sleep is really a restorative process for your mind and body. I'm curious, do you notice any changes or benefits after a good sleep? For instance, better concentration, improved mood, or even increased physical performance?","84":"REM sleep is not a perfect indicator of total sleep duration, but it can certainly help gauge sleep quality. If you want to track your sleep more accurately, I suggest keeping a sleep diary. This way, you can monitor your sleep schedule and identify any irregularities or issues.","85":null,"86":"That's quite an extended slumber, don't you think? It's a common practice among sleep scientists to monitor subjects as they cycle through different sleep stages, sometimes for hours on end.","87":"Absolutely! Quantum mechanics has some fascinating applications, including quantum computing. If you remember, quantum computers employ quantum-mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to process data more efficiently than classical computers. This is achievable due to qubits, or quantum bits, which can represent more than just 0s and 1s. They can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at once, and they can also become entangled with other qubits. This enables quantum computers to operate on numerous calculations concurrently and exchange information more quickly via entanglement. The implications of quantum computers are potentially groundbreaking, influencing fields such as cryptography, chemistry, and artificial intelligence. What's more, the development of nanotechnology has facilitated the possibility of developing quantum computers on a small scale, possibly even at the nanometer scale. Nanotechnology refers to manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular level. It can generate materials and devices with unique properties, such as extreme strength, exceptional temperature resistance, and remarkable electrical conductivity. The convergence of quantum computing and nanotechnology makes for an intriguing area of research\u2014the possibilities for rapid technological advancement are endless!","88":"Quantum dots are minute semiconductor particles, typically falling between 2 to 10 nanometers in size.

This is why they each bear their own distinct charm!","97":"In a sense, machine learning can be thought of as a sort of preparation for a test, much like doing reviews. The test may contain data we're not familiar with, but by training the computer to recognize patterns, we allow it to make informed decisions based on this data. It's like learning concepts before a test, and then applying that knowledge to solve new problems.","98":"So, it seems the machine learning model is acting much like you, learning from its errors and growing stronger. After each test, you refine your knowledge based on questions you answered wrong. In a similar way, the machine learning model learns from its inaccurate outputs and alters its behavior to deliver better results.","99":"We're diving into the fascinating world of the brain's connectome today, Let's explore how its intricate network of neurons contributes to our thoughts and actions.","100":"And did you know that a big group of cells in the brain is connected together in a special way?

You should be able to clearly explain the model's working and the underlying assumptions it makes. This helps users understand the reasons behind the model's decisions and can help identify any potential biases. It's also crucial to consistently monitor and address any biases that come to light. This includes not just adjusting the model, but also re-examining the data collection process to uncover any societal assumptions that might have been incorporated, and then addressing them.","109":"Yes, it's important to focus on the broader aspects of developing machine learning systems. Considering regulatory guidelines, ethical standards, and societal expectations will help create transparency, accountability, and fairness in decision-making processes. Furthermore, be thoughtful about the methods you use to control and minimize biases in data collection and usage. Ongoing evaluation and improvement in the early stages will allow you to proactively address potential issues, ensuring that the system remains valuable and socially acceptable.","110":"I've noticed that machine learning adoption varies across industries. Finance and healthcare are adopting it quickly due to its potential to boost efficiency and decision-making. Retail, however, has been more cautious, as they work on integrating it smoothly with their current systems. I'd advise industries that are hesitant not to entirely avoid it, as it holds the potential for significant growth and improvement.","111":"While it's true that these challenges can be discouraging, I remain optimistic about the future of AI. The key is addressing the gap between academia and industry, and ensuring that new generations of AI researchers and practitioners are well-educated on the ethical and practical applications of AI, as well as the collection and interpretation of data.","112":"I'd be happy to help explain that for you! Let's start with the basics. ","113":"Imagine that! Originami are created without cutting a single piece of paper.

Generally, the brightest regions correspond to closer proximity to the black hole, with the faintest regions indicating further distances from the black hole.","119":null,"120":"I think this could possibly be due to the difficulty in detecting black holes without an accretion disk, since neutron stars have their own pulsations that make them more easily spotted. Additionally, black holes may have been formed through different mechanisms like the pair-instantons or collapsars, which might not create a remnant that can be detected following the supernova explosion.","121":"So, to clarify, a black hole actually doesn't swallow anything. Instead, due to its extremely strong gravitational pull, everything that gets too close simply gets removed from our visible universe. This is called the event horizon, where even light can't escape.","122":"A possible experiment could involve training both a deep learning model and a traditional model, each utilizing features extracted uniquely for analysis. The deep learning model could use automatically generated features from the text, while the traditional model could use features derived from lexicons or template matching techniques. Evaluating their performances on the debate data would help determine the optimal approach in this situation, considering the tradeoffs between the complexity of deep learning and the interpretability of traditional methods.","123":"I absolutely agree with you that the question of bias in models can be quite complex. To approach this problem quantitatively, we could collect a robust dataset of the model's predictions and analyze any discrepancies in the results between gendered prompts of the form 'the woman was' vs 'the man was'. It's crucial to remember, however, that a model is simply a reflection of the data it has been trained on, and as a result, it may replicate the biases inherent in that data.

The reason is that everything around you, like the ground, is moving at the same speed. This makes you feel like you're not moving because gravity keeps pulling you towards the ground. As a result, when the ground moves, you move with it to maintain contact.","161":"That's quite an intriguing effect! It's called gravitational time dilation, a direct result of Einstein's special theory of relativity. In the frame of reference of the moving train, gravity pulls the ball back towards you as if you were in your living room. That might seem odd from the outside, but within the train, it behaves as if you were stationary. Local measurements reveal this peculiar behavior, and it's a manifestation of how gravitational forces affect space and time.","162":"I've always pondered about that fascinating question - if a person weighs less on the moon due to its lower gravity, wouldn't we feel lighter here on Earth because of the distance between us?

The Schwinger limit is a theoretical limit that prevents the vacuum from spontaneously creating electron-positron pairs due to the extremely high energy density of the quantum field. To overcome this limit, high-intensity fields are typically required, and it seems that a common laser light may not provide enough energy.","243":"Or we can take the more practical approach by employing deriving equations for a collisional particle accelerator in the lab frame.

This typically happens when the program tries to access a memory location it's not supposed to, leading to unpredictable behavior or a crash.","249":"In the realm of network security, buffer overloading can be a crucial vulnerability, particularly in networked programs that interact with users via a network interface. This is because an attacker can exploit buffer overflow by sending maliciously crafted input that overflows a buffer, leading to corruption of adjacent memory and potentially overwriting the return address. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system by making the processor jump to a different address instead of the intended return address after the function completes. This kind of attack, referred to as a buffer overflow attack, is a common method for gaining unauthorized access to systems. Therefore, understanding buffer overflow and how to prevent it is essential in designing software for penetration testing, as it helps in identifying and addressing weaknesses before they can be exploited by potential attackers.","250":"I got into cybersecurity because I find it fascinating how technology is shaping the world, especially in areas like global politics and security.

Let's think about it this way: even though it appears three-dimensional now, it's important to remember that it started as a flat, two-dimensional piece of paper. Each crease and fold is just a transformation or repetition of its original two-dimensional shape. So, in essence, it's still two-dimensional, but it's taken on a new form through the process of crumpling.","306":"I need 4 boxes to cover the line.

Could you please tell me the number of boxes you would need to cover the coastline if you were to perform the box-counting experiment?","308":"That's correct! The box counting method helps us understand this phenomenon. By measuring the coastline with boxes of different sizes, we can see how the number of boxes changes as the size of the boxes changes. This gives us an idea of the 'fractal' nature of the coastline, meaning it has a complex structure that repeats at different scales.","309":"Absolutely! Fractals have a wide range of applications.

Our brains have specific areas, like the hippocampus and amyggdala, that help us form and recall memories. These memories are then stored in the neocortex for long-term retention. However, not all memories last forever. Our brains prioritize certain memories based on factors such as emotion and novelty.","331":"The amyggala helps us remember scary things to avoid similar situations in the future. For example, if you accidentally cut yourself, your brain will remember the pain and associate it with danger, helping you make safer decisions when encountering sharp objects again.","332":"And as you continue to divide these segments into smaller and smaller parts, the pattern never ends, creating an infinite sequence.

Imaging large biological objects, such as bones, focuses on detecting and visualizing the bulk magnetic properties of the material. On the other hand, quantum sensing targets the minute changes in the quantum state of individual particles, like electrons or spins, which requires a higher level of sensitivity and precision due to the quantum mechanical properties involved.","340":"For instance, maintaining the coherence of the quantum states can be challenging due to interactions with the noisy environment and the need for precise control over the system. Additionally, scaling up to larger systems can present challenges, as each additional atom or photon increases the complexity of keeping coherence and control over the system.","341":"That's correct! Quantum systems can indeed be quite sensitive to fluctuations. These fluctuations can cause the system to transition from one state to another, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.","342":"One possible solution is to implement filters to block out these unwanted signals. Alternatively, we could adjust our experimental frequency to avoid interfering with the FM stations.","343":"To minimize or eliminate this noise, we usually aim to isolate the quantum system from its environment, a process known as shielding. Additionally, we carefully select materials to minimize defects that can couple into the system and generate noise.","344":"In quantum sensing, we're primarily concerned with two types of noise: quantum fluctuations, which are an inherent instability in the quantum state, and external noise sources such as vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and magnetic field variations. Quantum fluctuations can introduce noise that degrades the sensitivity of the measurement, while external noise sources can also affect the measurement outcome.","345":"That's an intriguing thought! Quantum computation could potentially offer unique solutions to such problems. Have you considered exploring this avenue further?","346":"That's truly exciting! The surge in the number of scientists specializing in quantum sensing will not only accelerate the pace of development but also foster collaboration and innovation.

Unlike classical computing, quantum systems can change unpredictably when observed or measured. This makes maintaining a stable system a complex task, as we're trying to build a nearly perfect computer out of imperfect parts. Classical computing, on the other hand, achieves reliability through repetition and error correction techniques that don't disturb the system's state.","349":"The reason for this is that each qubit added increases the likelihood of decoherence, which can potentially erase the quantum state of the entire system.","350":"Explainee: Right now, the main challenge is to build a quantum computer that can maintain its quantum state for a long enough period. This is crucial for quantum algorithms to work effectively. As of now, we can only keep the quantum state stable for a few milliseconds at best.

This allows for multiple packets from different sources to share the same network resources, making the network more flexible and scalable.","356":"Well, the term 'keys to the internet' is a bit of a metaphor, but it refers to the protocols that allow computers to communicate. There are four main protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Protocol (IP), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). TCP and UDP handle the transmission of data, while IP defines the structure of data packets and their delivery, and HTTP is used for transferring data on the web.","357":"So it's more like a free-for-all, with no single authority dictating decisions or paths?","358":null,"359":"Data packets are typically routed through a complex network of servers, routers, and switches.

Instead, we search for a diamond with the appropriate defects naturally present. The identification process of such a diamond is meticulous and involves extensive testing.","364":"Quantum computing makes use of the concept of superposition, where a quantum bit can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This property can be utilized in a nitrogen-vacancy center. For example, you can have the vacancy trapped in one of two states, and you can measure it and it will always be found in one of these states. However, if you don't measure it, and you keep it in a superposition, then every possible state that the nitrogen-vacancy can be in is simultaneously present.","365":"Yes, that's correct! A quantum sensor would use the instability of superposition states in a quantum system to detect and measure changes in its environment. In essence, it's like taking a quantum computer out into the world and observing how it behaves differently due to environmental changes.","366":"Yes, an atomic clock is indeed a type of quantum sensor.

Instead, your device sends a request to a content delivery network (CDN), which is a group of servers spread out geographically. These servers work together to distribute the content efficiently. If a server doesn't have the file, it can ask another server in the network for it. This way, many people can download the same content quickly.","373":"The server sends the specific video files for Vampire Diaries to your device, which then decodes and plays them on your screen, ensuring a smooth and unscrambled viewing experience.","374":"A function is a mapping of inputs to outputs, where each input is associated with exactly one output.","375":"And this is the essence of Cantor's diagonal argument. By creating a number that is not in our correspondence, we show that the two sets cannot be the same size. So, while it may seem like we can match the integers with the natural numbers one-to-one, we've actually missed some integers. Therefore, the sets of integers and natural numbers are not the same size, and both are infinite, but of different sizes.","376":"Yes, you're correct that there might be a bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers, but Cantor's Diagonal Argument shows that such a function doesn't exist, which means the number of rational numbers is indeed larger than that of the integers.","377":"That's correct! The slope is represented by a triplet (3, 2, 3), where 25 corresponds to 2. This representation reveals that there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","378":"Actually, the real numbers and the natural numbers are considered as the same size infinity under the concept of countable infinity. However, the real numbers are technically 'larger' in a way that can't be fully captured in the context of simple counting. This 'larger' set is called uncountable and is a fascinating topic in the realms of mathematical set theory. I apologize for any confusion earlier.","379":"Now, let's compare the new number I've created by modifying the diagonal elements with the first number on the list. Since at least one of the diagonal elements differs, this newly created number must be distinct from the original number on the list.","380":"So, if we list out all the possible numbers with a different first digit than the ones in the given list, this new number will be unique, since it has the specified initial digit.","381":"So, that's it! We've shown that there's a hole in the sequence, and that's why we can't match the natural numbers with the real numbers one-to-one. In simpler terms, the real number world is bigger than the natural number world, with more numbers in it.","382":"The conjecture circuit you're discussing is a set of instructions designed to be executed by a quantum computer. It leverages quantum mechanics principles to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, thanks to the unique properties of quantum bits or qubits.","383":"They work by using external microphones to analyze background noise and then produce an equal but opposite sound wave through the speakers to cancel out the original noise. This helps in reducing the noise you hear.","384":"To build quantum computers, we create quantum bits, or qubits, and place them in a superposition of states using Hadamard gates. We then use controlled-NOT gates to create entanglement between qubits. This entanglement allows us to perform calculations through interference, where qubits can either reinforce or cancel each other out based on their states.","385":"As a programmer, quantum computing would require a different approach to writing programs, as it operates on the principles of superposition and entanglement. This means that you would need to learn new quantum programming languages and algorithms, such as Q#, Qiskit, or Cirq.

When a massive star like our sun collapses under its own gravity, it can form a black hole. This process results in a singularity, a point of infinite density. The gravitational pull around it is so intense that not even light can escape, hence the term 'black hole'.","390":"The light is pulled towards the black hole due to its strong gravitational force, causing it to bend and fall in instead of escaping.","391":"A choice function is a powerful tool that picks a single option from a given set, and assigns a unique output to it.

Zero-knowledge proof systems, on the other hand, involve transmitting information without revealing the underlying data. So, while there is information being transmitted, it's not the same as the data itself. That's why it's called zero-data.","400":"Indeed, it implies that we can demonstrate ownership of a secret without disclosing the secret itself, correct?","401":"In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover demonstrates knowledge of the data without revealing any information about the data itself.

Quantum logic gates, like the CNOT gate, work on these qubits, manipulating their states in ways that classical gates do not.","412":"To initialize a quantum computer, we set each qubit to a specific state, often a combination of 0s and 1s that represents the initial state of our problem. For example, if we want to solve a problem with two possible solutions, we might set the first qubit to represent the first solution and the second qubit to represent the second solution.","413":"So we need to design algorithms that have a high probability of producing the correct answer, even though the intermediate steps might involve some level of randomness or uncertainty.

Normally, these particles annihilate each other, but if one falls into the black hole, the other escapes, leading to the loss of mass and energy from the black hole, effectively emitting radiation.","432":"What we're discovering through studying black holes is that they might be the key to unifying general relativity (gravity) with quantum mechanics, which would finally give us a theory of quantum gravity. As black holes are the result of colossal matter concentrations, they force us to confront the limitations of our current understanding of gravity at extraordinarily high densities, pushing us to explore new theories like loop quantum gravity or string theory.","433":"Explainer: Right! Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a special type of proof where the prover can demonstrate to the verifier that they know a specific value or possess a certain property, without revealing any more information than necessary. It's a powerful tool for ensuring privacy in sensitive computations.","434":"That's an interesting perspective! When we look at randomness from a different angle, it can indeed bring about some unexpected benefits.","435":"Indeed, the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs in cloud computing is promising, but it's crucial to address privacy and security concerns associated with sensitive data. How can we ensure that data remains secure while still leveraging the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs?","436":"Explainee: If you then return to the place where the orange juice wasn't very good, but now you might recall the delightful vacation with a refreshing glass of orange juice, and it would change your perspective on the orange juice from that place.","437":"Indeed, the uncertainty and the second-guessing about the decision could stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for memory recall, as your brain might be prompted to recall more details or information about the options you were weighing, in an attempt to determine whether your choice was indeed the best one.","438":"That's a wonderful pick! I particularly enjoy the scene where Matilda uses her powers to help Miss Honey. It's a beautiful demonstration of the power of empathy and the impact it can have on others.","439":"The video would likely traverse the network through a series of nodes, such as from the source to the first relay, then to the second relay, and so on, until it reaches the final destination, thus completing the network route for the video transfer.","440":"Actually, that's a good question. Routing is used to find the most efficient path for the data to travel, taking into account factors such as network congestion, distance, and available resources. This way, the data can take the quickest and most reliable route to get to its destination.","441":"This approach, known as the shortest path, is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the internet. It helps in distributing the internet traffic evenly, preventing congestion in any specific path. This way, data transfer becomes faster and more reliable.","442":"Hey there! I'm your friendly guide on the internet, here to share interesting facts and tidbits. Today, let's talk about lettuce!","443":"That's an interesting perspective! It seems like we're still exploring the intricacies of how our minds create and navigate these cognitive spaces. I wonder if there are any specific theories or studies that delve deeper into this topic, such as how individuals create their personal mental maps and how these maps influence their responses to new contexts or environments.","444":"Explainee: That's an interesting perspective! So, our brain essentially simulates past experiences by recalling the essential elements and filling in the gaps with stored models, creating a memory-like experience.","445":"Black holes are incredibly dense celestial objects with a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape. They are key to our understanding of the universe, as they help us comprehend the formation and evolution of the cosmos.","446":"It's believed to be a black hole due to several reasons. Firstly, the frequency and the particular pattern of the waves are consistent with those produced by the collision of two black holes. Secondly, black holes are the only known objects with enough mass and density to produce gravitational waves that we can detect with LIGO. Lastly, the data is also used to calculate the mass and the spin of the colliding black holes, and these values also fit what we expect for black holes.","447":"When a black hole merges with another or collides with a massive object, it generates gravitational waves. These waves propagate through space-time, and on Earth, they are detected by instruments like LIGO and Virgo. These observatories measure the minute changes in length caused by the disturbance in space-time due to the gravitational waves. This allows scientists to study the behavior of black holes.","448":"I'm thrilled to have you here, Michael! I've been diving deep into Moravec's paradox, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. What are your thoughts on this fascinating concept?","449":"I agree with your point about promiscuous generalization of agents. Moravec's Paradox, however, suggests that while high-level tasks are challenging for robots, low-level tasks, such as complex physical manipulations, are relatively easier. This discrepancy between our assumptions and reality makes it difficult to create intelligent agents. To address this, it might be more effective to focus on developing robots capable of low-level physical tasks before delving into high-level cognition, in an effort to prevent promiscuous generalization.","450":"That's fascinating! How does our memory of past interactions with similar social stimuli affect our current perceptions and judgments?","451":"Let's delve deeper into how memory interacts with our perceptions and social judgments. Can you share some examples that illustrate this connection?","452":"That's fascinating! It's definitely worth considering how personal experiences and associations can influence our emotional responses. For example, one person might associate a specific scent with a happy childhood memory, while another person might associate it with a negative experience. Our emotions and memories are deeply interconnected and unique to each individual, which can lead to diverse emotional reactions to similar stimuli.","453":"Right, and I've been considering that our emotional responses, or the way we recall them, can often be significantly shaped by the social or cultural context in which we encounter them. This can potentially introduce biases or inconsistencies in how we perceive and interpret our memories.","454":"That's an interesting perspective! So, if the hippocampus is damaged, the brain might find an alternative way to form episodic memories. Could you elaborate on how this alternative process works?","455":"How about I challenge the robot to solve a multiplication problem with two-digit numbers? Let's see if it can handle that!","456":"I'm not confident about performing the task with my eyes closed. With my eyes open, I can observe the patterns and anticipate my movements. I'm unsure if I can replicate the actions without the visual cues.","457":"That's fascinating! It's known as Moravec's Paradox. This principle suggests that tasks that are easy for humans, like recognizing sounds or faces, are often difficult for machines, while tasks that are difficult for humans, like solving complex mathematical problems, are relatively easy for machines. This paradox has significant implications for AI development.","458":"Robots don't have the same emotional or self-awareness as humans, so they don't 'know' they've made a mistake in the same way we do. However, they can be programmed to recognize errors in their tasks and correct them.","459":"Robots don't have the ability to deviate from their programming or make decisions based on personal experiences or emotions. They follow the instructions they've been given and respond to the input they receive.","460":"While robots are incredibly advanced, they lack the ability to make decisions or have consciousness. They can only perform the tasks they were designed for, and their actions are limited to their programming. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that robots will take over the world.","461":"That's truly remarkable! It's incredible to see how technology has made it possible for even kids to create intricate and beautiful fractal patterns with relative ease.","462":"That's a great point! Another way to introduce fractals could be by discussing the famous Mandelbrot set, which visually demonstrates self-similarity at different scales. Or, you could talk about the mathematical properties of fractals, such as their infinite detail and non-integer dimensions.","463":"It's fascinating how the process of creating turbulence in computer graphics mirrors the principles of fractals, particularly the Mandelbrot set. In both cases, we're generating self-similar patterns by iteratively applying a simple rule to a set of values. It's quite remarkable how these mathematical concepts can mimic physical phenomena, such as turbulence in fluids.","464":"You uncover the mathematical secrets behind various fractals, and by numerically solving their equations, you can create stunning visuals that showcase self-similarity and infinite intricacy. It's like unlocking the hidden beauty of nature!","465":"And that's why fractals are so fascinating - they're a set of repeating patterns that can be found at various scales, allowing for simplicity and efficiency in their design.","466":"Scaling is indeed a step, but it's just the beginning. To make these virtual landscapes more immersive and interactive, we could incorporate elements that mimic real-world systems, such as weather, diverse and dynamic fauna, and geographical features that change over time. This could help to create a richer, more engaging, and less lonely experience.","467":"You're right, it's not possible to store an entire world in a computer. However, we can use techniques like fractal geometry to create intricate details and patterns that resemble certain aspects of the world, such as the branching of a tree or the shape of a coastline. These structures often have repeating patterns that can be described mathematically.","468":"He used a combination of simplifying the process and incorporating fractal algorithms to automate the creation of tree-like structures, resulting in visually stunning and detailed happy little trees.","469":"If all the numbers you can see are finite, then it would be a countable infinite set, as each integer can be enumerated one by one, even though the total number is infinite.","470":"Not in this room, but possibly in a larger space.","471":"That's an interesting perspective! So, if it's unlimited, what possibilities do you see arising?","472":"I'm not familiar with the term 'quantum'. Could you please explain it to me?","473":"This penny can be in two states, heads and tails, at the same time. This is a simplified explanation of superposition in quantum computing.","474":"Wow, that's mind-blowing! It's like having a supercomputer in your pocket, capable of performing complex calculations simultaneously, something that even the most advanced computers today can't do.","475":"That's fascinating! Quantum physics is such a complex and intriguing field. I'm sure your friends will be amazed by your newfound knowledge!","476":"In the realm of quantum sensing, we delve into the intricate world of measuring at a quantum level. We harness the unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, to refine our measurement precision significantly.","477":"An MRI uses a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and a computer to generate detailed images of the organs and tissues within your body. It's essentially a scanning method used in medicine to visualize the internal structure of body tissues. Quantum sensing, on the other hand, employs quantum mechanical phenomena to detect tiny magnetic fields or small changes in electric fields that are too minute for traditional sensors to detect. This technology has potential applications in various fields, such as biology and geophysics.","478":"Can you tell me more about the different cells you're referring to?","479":"Indeed, there are several quantum sensors in the developmental stage. For instance, quantum microscopes, quantum magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) devices, and quantum clocks. Quantum microscopes could potentially offer superior resolution and sensitivity compared to classical microscopes. qMRI devices might provide higher resolution and sensitivity than conventional MRI scanners.
