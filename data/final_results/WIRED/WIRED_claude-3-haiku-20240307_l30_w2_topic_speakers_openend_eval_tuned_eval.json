Is there another verse to come?","1":"F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11. And then, G seven with a flat 13","2":"That's it! (laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven. A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11. Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible. So once we realize this its like, that's great! Now what should we do? What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible. So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally.","3":"So, there's a lot about context, I think. Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways. I think that's what makes the difference.","4":"I think I like to be creative. So I find fun in chess by learning 10 different openings, trying different positions. I like chaotic positions. I like positions where I can attack. I like positions where I'm getting attacked and I can maybe defend and find some creative way to turn things around, and I really, really struggle when I need to sit there and just do nothing.","5":"I think G6 is Leningrad. I've tried to find a name. I don't actually know the name of this one. I guess there's also like the Stonewall, right? You can play.","6":"I play like a lot of openings poorly. That's my approach to chess. I just play things that I think will be fun. Then the game starts going, and I'm like, Why did I play this? I should learn real openings. Okay, I guess I'll... Yeah, this is nice and boring.","7":"You are the eight-time United States women's chess champion. You also have the highest title in all of chess grandmaster. I'm an eternal runner up. Like what is the championship mentality, and how have you succeeded at it so many times?","8":"in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way? Easy to do?","9":"If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that? I mean, hold perfectly still. That's good. But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second, can you do that?","10":"He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading in that direction actually.He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?","11":"You build a spaceship. You go out into space really quickly. You turn around and you come back to planet Earth, and he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?","12":"Maybe, that's absolutely right. I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past, but it's not been ruled out. That's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility.","13":"Yeah. We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right? In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains. It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about.","14":"It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?","15":"Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well. I call it job security. That's right. (both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding.","16":"Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional. But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity. This is the crucial thing, right? Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space. And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard.","17":"Why? This is a very good question. So, let's just start with space, right? We know a little bit about space. So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard. Let's say X and Y. And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right? And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates. It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever. I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path. There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is. That's the point. The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve. So spacetime is like that. That's why it is useful to think about spacetime.","18":"When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?","19":"And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.","20":"Well kind of. What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe.","21":"There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric. And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time.","22":"So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.","23":"Yeah, exactly. If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected.","24":"A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.","25":"If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer. So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size. But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes. The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms. Have you ever heard of atoms before?","26":"I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties. They behave completely different than objects that are big. And because of that, we can build really cool things with them. Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells. And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos. You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new. Something interesting that no one's built before. It's like Legos for scientists.","27":"We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?","28":"Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","29":"Yeah. To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable. What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's gonna have to happen next?","30":"These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex. It's the number of lines. So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid.","31":"So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom. So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big.","32":"Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way. Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other.","33":"And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.","34":"There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.","35":"There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms. And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more. Any questions or thoughts about this?","36":"You try, we all gotta try. You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain. It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that. Sleep is made up of different parts. You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?","37":"So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.","38":"When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night. You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body. And so it's important to get both of those. And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3. So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are. And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay? N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping. Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep. And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3. And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep. And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day.","39":"You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.","40":"Okay? So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it. And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles.","41":"Okay. Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes. When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia. So what are the stages of sleep?","42":"Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?","43":"Yeah. So the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma. And we've taken most of the air out of the container, so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball, and very, very low temperature plasma. So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining, and becoming neutral again. And we see those energy transitions as the visible light. So if we're gonna put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it, like maybe make some clean electricity, we would have to control it. And another word for controlling it is confining it. So let me turn this off and set it back down. You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table? It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy. Have you played with magnets in school?","44":"Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?","45":"Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.","46":"I'm so glad you asked. So what we want to use the tokamak for in real life is to confine a super hot plasma, and we're talking a hundred million, 150 million degrees. Because the plasma is so very hot, the particles have enough energy to interact with one another and fuse. When those fusion reactions occur, we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus, and we can harness that energy to make clean electricity.","47":"So we are trying to bring a star to earth. We are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system, our sun, uses hydrogen to make helium and generates fusion energy that way. Instead on earth we're gonna be using isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. What do you know about charged particles? If I want to try and push two positively charged particles together, two protons together, what do you think is gonna happen?","48":"So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.","49":"Yes, exactly, exactly. That little bump up is good for us. Because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures. And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah, 50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.","50":"Exactly. So it comes right out. And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron. And we want it to interact with our overall energy system. And as it interacts with that material, it heats the material up. It transfers its kinetic energy to this material. Take that thermal energy and run a turbine, run a generator, and convert it into electricity. So once you get to that stage, it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant. Whether it's fission or natural gas. So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in, setting it in place, and driving your thermal system to make electricity. We often call it an alpha particle. And that is a charged particle, right. So it's actually going to stay in the plasma. It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel. So it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions. So now they're good, now we like them.","51":"It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?","52":"The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world. This is the origami lamp. It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together. The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base.","53":"New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong.","54":"It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper.","55":"It will develop. It will take five years. It will take 10 years. That kind of time is necessary. One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","56":"In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.","57":"When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today. I think we're in a similar place. We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility. But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","58":"All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?","59":"Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.","60":"I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.","61":"There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.","62":"All right, now I am tricking you. It can't be done. Yeah. Right? You can't do it. So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional. That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in.","63":"Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.","64":"So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?","65":"Time. Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself. But what about space? What about the solar system? Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?","66":"So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates.","67":"You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense.","68":"That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.","69":"You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally.","70":"This is where it gets really crazy. Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?","71":"Huh. It would be like if you simulated a hurricane. Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane. Ever. Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera. Temperature. And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right? I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet. Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are. Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?","72":"I think my audience once pulled 92% or below the level of 1,200, but it's really hard to learn chess because you don't get to experience learning content based on people who are your level. Like how did you really deduce how a 1,200 will play?","73":"Onto to E5 on the third move is the most challenging move against the Caro-Kann. It restricts the knight and the main line. So the move is bringing out the bishop, Bringing out the bishop. so you don't get locked. I play that move, but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to try to undermine the center. It's not commonly played at the highest level. If you study master games, this is probably one in every six games or something compared to, right? So now we go down a totally different path. We're taking a totally different train to our destination, but just this undermining of the position, you know, splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both, that does wonders at intermediate and early advanced level. This move, despite it being move three, according to databases, already gives black like a 53% chance of winning, which is crazy because normally white is about 52%, right? White just doesn't know what to do about this move.","74":"'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation. And there it was! And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it.","75":"Yeah, yeah. It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious. I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life.","76":"And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to. And we could talk about some stuff. I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip.","77":"Yeah, it's crazy. They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that. They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts.","78":"Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.","79":"In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.","80":"That's a very good point. You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law. They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product. And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys.","81":"I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.","82":"That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?","83":"When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game. Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier.","84":"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me. So we go way back. 1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore.","85":"And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter. We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.","86":"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing. I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea. And so do you think it's on the horizon? Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go? 'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right? We can't stay in the visual.","87":"Nowadays there's a lot of concerns around some applications of machine learning like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk and learn how you talk and even how we look, and generate videos of us. We're doing this for real, but you could imagine a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually.","88":"Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole. I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy.","89":"Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions? Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature. Temperature is not a thing. There is no single thing called temperature. It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms. And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?","90":"So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?","91":"Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?","92":"Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.","93":"That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?","94":"Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.","95":"It just depends what you're trying to do. In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years. So what have you learned about hacking?","96":"So have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics, that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward in time and backward in time? Is that something you're familiar with?","97":"A chicken. But then I say to you, where'd the chicken come from? And you'd say from an egg. But there's actually some real insight we can draw from this, because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story, we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of life, we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the galaxy, and ultimately, the universe, each step taking us to greater and greater order. So we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself. Highly ordered beginning called the Bang, and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since. We still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was, highly ordered. At the moment, it's really a deep assumption.","98":"Do you remember the scene in Interstellar? They're going to a planet that's near a black hole. They go down to the planet, and they spend just a couple hours there, but when they go back to the ship, it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field, comparatively quickly far away. And that's not science fiction, that's actually how time behaves.","99":"Okay. I just think of physics as the study of everything. What stuff is, what stuff does. So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions. Have you heard about dimensions?","100":"But here's what I want you to think about. If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?","101":"We need one number to tell you where we are. That's one dimension. That's what it means to be one dimensional. I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are.","102":"So those are the dimensions. That's how we think about dimensions. Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane.","103":"This is why physicists think about things we don't know about. We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen. Yeah. That are tinier than atoms. So, okay. So what have you learned? What do you know about dimensions now? How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?","104":"I think so. I think you're right. All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day. Does that sound like a fun idea?","105":"I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?","106":"So these are typically semiconductors. They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms. They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers. What's interesting about these materials?","107":"Carbon nanotube, right. So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties. So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal. If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor. The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene. And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics. The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment. And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics. It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them.","108":"It's just pretty lights. [laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier. So that's the story I'm going to stick with. [laughing] I like it.","109":"You know, you're right. When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction. But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time. Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?","110":"So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances. We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage.","111":"You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now.","112":"Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?","113":"Yeah, if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks take off time at different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?","114":"So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen. They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future? And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale. Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system. Essentially, that just got them into the network. and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there.","115":"If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory. So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character? But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes? Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?","116":"So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from. So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth. That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter.","117":"So my son is five years old. And he asked me what kind of science I do. And I said fusion. And I said I put a star in a jar. Does that make sense?","118":"All right, so an atom is what everything in our world is made of. And at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus. And inside that nucleus is a proton. We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?","119":"You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?","120":"With the iron filing. So if you take this and you take the magnetic end, maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it. While you move around those iron filings with the magnet, you're totally in control of that material. You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around. And so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you. Have you learned about the states of matter?","121":"Yes, we absolutely do. We hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields. So you didn't have to actually touch the iron filings in the toy to move them around. You could pass the magnetic field through the plastic and control them with it. So it's the same thing. We don't have to touch this very, very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields. You are so smart. I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject.","122":"[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.","123":"And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes! Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.","124":"Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual? Yeah. That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?","125":"Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it? So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?","126":"A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?","127":"One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","128":"Okay. So this is about high intensity lasers. Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics. We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?","129":"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility. So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?","130":"I'm still a believer that the magic's out there. We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula. I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic.","131":"So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space. Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance. We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point. And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it? And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth. So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere. Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations. One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life. So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator? Those aren't gravitational objects. So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box. And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall.","132":"You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall. So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?","133":"Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc. And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc. So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved.","134":"You went, Oh. [Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along. And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard. But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments.","135":"So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity. So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth. And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us. And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity. So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve. And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there. And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line.","136":"And I dare say, even though you might not have put this word on it, odds are you executed as a human, multiple algorithms today even before you came here today. Like what were a few things that you did?","137":"That, in of itself, is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem. So, it turns out that back in my day, before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers from my schools were literally printed in a book, and everyone in my town and my city, my state was printed in an actual phone book. Even if you've never seen this technology before, how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book?","138":"Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?","139":"Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.","140":"And maybe alternatively, if I get to like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, if I get to the K section, then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages. So, the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take one extra step. So, I think it's fixable, but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here, and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book in English, what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly?","141":"Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.","142":"Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.","143":"And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?","144":"That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.","145":"So, here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms, looking for John in the phone book. But the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer, where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it, that is you try to chop it up into smaller, smaller, smaller pieces. A more sophisticated type of algorithm, at least depending on how you implement it, something known as a recursive algorithm. Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller, and smaller ultimately.","146":"Excellent. I got an engineering physics degree. There you go, something in common. We're here today talking about lasers. So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?","147":"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color. Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color. And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time. One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on. If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors. And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra. When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes. But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music. So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now. And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter. So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other. And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.","148":"So these are things we would call features. And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another. So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian.","149":"It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere. And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning. We're really developing a notion of what good looks like.","150":"You can just barely tell. And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there. And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry. Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places. So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that. Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking. And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there. So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now. Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem. What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here. We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us. But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people.","151":"So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function. We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials. That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology? It is a chemistry driven approach. We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us.","152":"One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines. My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics. And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward. And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together.","153":"The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.","154":"The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well. Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--","155":"Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains. Do you know what a brain is? What is it?","156":"Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see. (Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain.","157":"To note our recent paper, where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the space time, we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension and thought about how special relativity works in that setting, we came to a result in this very basic setting. You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?","158":"One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists, that if someone's moving relative to me, what they consider now might be in my past, what they consider now might be in my future, which would suggest that all of time exists much as we're willing to accept that all of space exists. Is that cold water?","159":"So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it.","160":"The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems. You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet. Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?","161":"What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.","162":"But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone. I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?","163":"Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?","164":"We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible? It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself. Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases. You can just attack that check. And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles. It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see. Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself. And also, how do you know that you've seen it? I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber. A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol. And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch. Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit. The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it. What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research? Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking.","165":"For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before. I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light.","166":"It's a good one. The melody on its own just goes. (hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right? And no one really knows how it feels. (plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?","167":"Yeah, ah, that's great. I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is. That's what musical harmony is. Does that make sense?","168":"One of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will, shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space. But once you have a shortcut from here to there, the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings, time will elapse differently at the different openings. So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past. But that, of course, raises philosophical and logical--","169":"Yeah, so you go into the past, and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting, but you're preventing them from meeting in the parallel reality, which means that you will never be born in that reality, but the origin of your birth is still completely understood, it was in the universe from which you originated. Another one that's more subtle is, the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding.","170":"But the finding was, the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening. And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment.","171":"And imagine I turn on two laser beams, sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left. And these beams will go around the entirety of space, and they'll both come back, and at some point, they will hit me. Imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective. Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment. They fire the beam of light left and right. Notice that the beam that they fire to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it. Whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense, they're moving toward it. The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer at the same moment.","172":"No, everybody else is moving relative to me, and it's real motion. So everybody else will be like the moving twin. They will be younger and I will be older. And when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale, there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe. The fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between, does that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker?","173":"It can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing, where none of what we do sort of persist. On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around and say, How remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate, wow, how wonderful is that?","174":"For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?","175":"I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?","176":"But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?","177":"Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?","178":"The easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we each have? Right now, it's eight. So think of it like a fence, right? So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?","179":"Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?","180":"So that's like immediately you get a reward, but I'll give you a hint. The best way to start looking for a tactic, always look for a check first. Do you have a way to attack my king?","181":"And then you would take the rook. Now the funny thing is you are now totally winning, right? But as we know in chess, maybe one day white will make a mistake in the future. So there's no point for black to surrender here, but this is definitely a really good start.","182":"Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties. And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again. So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?","183":"30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster. And that's not really true today. For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world. It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot. So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster. What do you do? You can't just say make each thing faster. As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun. And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons. So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things. But you can always just design a game that will just not work well. (laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed. Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom. You really can--","184":"But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be.","185":"When you give up most of what you want? Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure. What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?","186":"That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do. So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for. With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person.","187":"That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?","188":"So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez. And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra. Do you know who that is?","189":"And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine. What do you think might go into that?","190":"Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny. And I think that's because they're based on so much data. They know where you live. They know where your device is. It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us.","191":"So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors. Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special. It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right? It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam. In a laser, it comes out as a single color. They all come out with their waves at the same time. Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power. So it can do something like cutting steel. But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light. That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it. So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works. So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail. I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood. We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.","192":"Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--","193":"Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.","194":"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.","195":"Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--","196":"Into a spot. So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down. Hit a lens and it would have to focus down. But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much. Eventually it would be here, more concentrated. But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer. Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away. So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?","197":"Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami. Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules. It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts. So these guys are folded from an uncut square.","198":"Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.","199":"Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands. We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge. Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?","200":"Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.","201":"So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center. We'll fold it in half like a book. On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers. There's a pocket in the middle. We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together. Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out. This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-","202":"Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.","203":"There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago.","204":"What is I think very true about what you're hinting at is that bubble sort really focuses on local, small problems rather than taking a step back trying to fix the whole thing, let's just fix the obvious problems in front of us. So, for instance, when we're trying to get from smallest to largest, and the first two things we see are eight followed by one, this looks like a problem 'cause it's out of order. So, what would be the simplest fix, the least amount of work we can do to at least fix one problem?","205":"All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.","206":"And certainly the search engines of the world, Google and Bing and so forth, they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order 'cause that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data. But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly, just like we, do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information. So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?","207":"Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.","208":"In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.","209":"Yeah, you feel pinned to that. It's exactly like that. There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating.","210":"That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.","211":"So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving? There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true. You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear. But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary.","212":"So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?","213":"So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, No. 300,000 kilometers per second. Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her. The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life. How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time. And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina. And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time. [laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time. Just from that one simple starting point. So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?","214":"Right? And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space.","215":"Yeah. So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that. So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space. You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large.","216":"Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?","217":"Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.","218":"But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.","219":"I guess. I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise. Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?","220":"And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?","221":"And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it. Plenty of reading material for the audience out there.","222":"Awesome, good. (laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain. It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other.","223":"We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back. Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right? And we knew how neurons fire. Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?","224":"So chess is separated into three games, obviously. You have your opening, which is the early stage of the game. Then we have the middle game, right? The most confusing, mysterious side of the game, and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board. You gotta have to know how to convert positions, defend positions, understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that. So for you, what do you struggle with the most?","225":"In all middle games where we have this mix of tactics, which are immediate gain or immediate loss, depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one, and strategic chess. I just want you to tell me, who do you think has a better position here and by how much?","226":"This is how we unlock the intermediate level, which is this move. That move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board, right? It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also.","227":"Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?","228":"Yes. Another thing for middle game. So we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge. Pawn breaks for the opponent, and then, every time something moves, like a pawn, we have to look around. What else is now opening up? And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-","229":"Yes, but before we advance, we need to prepare it, right? Because you push it now, these two would win that trade. So yeah, rookie 8 is a very good move. You used kind of like a heuristic, right? Well, black has two knights. So black prefers the position closed because decide what the bishops wants to be able to see the whole board. Yes, exactly, but your opponent disagreed with you and took this pawn because that's just what intermediate players do. They see they can take something. Pawn for pawn. What the heck? Like, sure, and you did this. Now what does this move change in the white position?","230":"Yes, exactly. So now in the snap of your fingers, you can get your bishop out and the rook, two things that a move ago were just totally blocked in by a pawn, exactly. So in the middle game, trades are either good or bad for you and for your opponent.","231":"So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad. A triad is a three-part harmony, basically. (keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad. So this triad's called C major.","232":"So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now? I don't know where I am. (scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense.","233":"That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.","234":"[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.","235":"That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't. In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon. On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?","236":"They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.","237":"Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?","238":"Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.","239":"But it's a good story. So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time.","240":"They look the same, but this is much heavier, right? Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force. So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?","241":"I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it, because the fuel for fusion is a plasma, and we don't experience plasmas on earth in our everyday life.","242":"They exist in space, at the event horizon of a black hole, in the solar wind, in our sun, or very rapid events, like lightning is also sort of a very weakly ionized plasma. Even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas. There are low temperature, higher density plasmas. There are of course the astrophysical plasmas, and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas. They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas. They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro-instabilities.","243":"Plus magnetic fields. When we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma, we can no longer even think about the plasma as a single fluid. Instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately. We have to use a full blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving. Because we have collisions. So we have to add collisions back in to understand and track how all the particles are moving, and how these collective motions, this turbulence can get kicked up. So that's pretty intractable, right?","244":"So one really big advance in plasma theory over the last I'd say three or four decades has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory that we use to model the micro-turbulence in the plasma and get that under control. And the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism. the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system. Being able to study it, measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to overcome.","245":"And we talked about how challenging it would be to follow every particle in space and know its position, and know its velocity at all times. So what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop a charged particle into a strong external magnetic field, the Lorentz force bends that particle's trajectory into a helix. And so now if we know that wherever the field line is going that particle is following it in this helical, in this corkscrew trajectory, we can say aha, I no longer have to worry about following that particle's velocity around in a circle, 'cause at every point in time I know it's going in a circle.","246":"And it has a particular radius of that helix called the gyro radius, because it's just gyrating. So what we know from studying the plasma and making direct measurements of the turbulence and also what comes from the simulations is the scale size of the turbulence is about 5 to 10 gyro radii.","247":"So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.","248":"Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.","249":"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?","250":"That's true, that laser's just a dot. And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do! But it seems awfully bright doesn't it? And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?","251":"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?","252":"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend. And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.","253":"So this is just a demonstration. If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end. It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side. You wanna play? So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?","254":"That's a laser. We cut steel with them now. We actually do surgery with lasers. You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see? We can actually remove those with lasers now. Never seen a laser light show? When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.","255":"The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.","256":"There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?","257":"Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.","258":"So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.","259":"That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.","260":"If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want.","261":"So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things. So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?","262":"This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog. But you made a good guess. That's what machines do too. They make guesses. Is this a cat or a dog?","263":"So machines work the same way. If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess. And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that. So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly. But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples? Would you be able to do that so quickly?","264":"So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly? You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","265":"We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","266":"It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people. Like, you could have it on your computer. And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list. So it's sort of constantly updating itself.","267":"That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.","268":"Yeah, or in Minecraft. When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it. Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing. And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not. Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?","269":"When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily. As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right? If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value. But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology. There is some kind of interface for it. You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code.","270":"In some cases, yeah, it is. And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency. A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency. And it's kind of exciting. But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side. They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology.","271":"To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point. So, let's come back to the crane. You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?","272":"Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.","273":"The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.","274":"And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles. So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle. Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want. We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points. If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider. So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug. We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles. So any thoughts which might be?","275":"Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful.","276":"So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?","277":"Yeah, exactly. And computers have even different types of memory. They have what's called RAM, random access memory, which is where your games, where your programs are stored while they're being used. But then it also has a hard drive, or a solid state drive, which is where your data, your high scores, your documents, once you start writing essays and stories in the future.","278":"Why don't we do it this way? Why don't we pretend like I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot, so I only understand your instructions and so I want you to feed me, no pun intended, an algorithm. So, step-by-step instructions for solving this problem. But remember, algorithms, you have to be precise, you have to give...","279":"[laughing] Clean all this mess up, right. We made an algorithm, step by step instructions for solving some problem. And if you think about now, how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sometimes we were imprecise and you didn't give me quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly, and that's why I took out so much bread. Precision, being very, very correct with your instructions is so important in the real world because for instance, when you're using the worldwide web and you're searching for something on Google or Bing...","280":"Pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm, even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it. Because you and I are sort of following instructions either that we came up with ourselves or maybe our parents told us how to do these things. And so, those are just algorithms. But when you start using algorithms in computers, that's when you start writing code.","281":"Really glad that you could join us. So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity. But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?","282":"So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia. When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?","283":"Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain. This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate.","284":"Where we're going with a lot of the experiments right now is trying to produce some maybe outside-the-box datasets that we haven't seen before, and then of course ultimately compare them to the simulations and do a bit of this validation maybe where we're not just looking under the lamppost, where we're going a little bit outside the comfort zone. That means going from measurements really sort of more in the middle of the plasma, at about mid-radius, pushing all the way out to the edge, where the turbulence starts to become very different in its nature, it becomes a lot more electromagnetic, it becomes sometimes larger in scale, just physical scale size. And some of the things we're starting to find was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas don't always behave the way we think they do. So as we think about pushing our measurements and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge, how does that influence what you're working on now?","285":"Okay, that's great. On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds. And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center. So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out.","286":"You got it. Ooh! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know? Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace. Let's play it in its simplest form.","287":"When you find a target and you have a way to create threats, attacks against that target, against that goal, but you do it without sacrificing your resources, right? So you can imagine two boxers, right? One is being pushed into a corner. He could still win, he could totally still win, but for now, one side is definitely the aggressor.","288":"The tough thing about chess is you can have a good position, but you actually have to move pieces. You know, like a piece of art, you just say, Oh, it's done.","289":"Black has an initiative. But can black capitalize on this initiative? I don't know. The problem with having a position like this is you feel a lot of pressure to do something.","290":"Yeah, that's the chess player's sign of focus, just- Yeah, when you roll up the sleeves. I guess I have to defend my pawn. I mean, don't really want to, but fine.","291":"That's good, that's a great place to start. There are cells in your brain. Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other. Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections.","292":"You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it. Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity. Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole. You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently. And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--","293":"It does. In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions. Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes.","294":"We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure. But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different. So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse.","295":"Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.","296":"That's the good news. The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional. [chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong. It can't be right. Spacetime is not ten-dimensional. Spacetime is four dimensional. We've observed that. But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow. So here's how we could get lucky. We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them. This is actually an old idea. It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915. But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions. There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed. But here's the new, exciting idea. So let's imagine, okay. This is a piece of paper. But let's imagine this is our entire world. So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here. You and I live here. But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space. So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay? And let's imagine that. When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface. This is what we call a brane. B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?","297":"From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?","298":"If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.","299":"Well basically the strings are the particles that we see. It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional. A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating. If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle. So in string theory, an electron is a little string. A photon is a little string.","300":"It's even better. It's the theory of everything. What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?","301":"If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,","302":"Right. Sometimes. I mean, for example, in medical research, how amazing would it be, right, to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove that my drug works in this model.","303":"in a zero-knowledge way, without any interaction, right. I can just take the program, convert it to a zero-knowledge program, or an obfuscated program, and then just send it to you.","304":"So that's a great definition and I wanna pick that apart a little bit. So what you described is just right. Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are gonna collapse under their own weight. It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core, and if the core itself is heavy enough, it will keep collapsing. It does, as you say, reach this point where not even light can escape. But the amazing thing is it leaves that point, you called it rightly the event horizon, it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record because the start itself can no more sit at the event horizon than it can race outward at the speed of light. So the core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows. So in a weird way, the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter. It left it behind in its wake, but the stuff of the star is gone.","305":"Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.","306":"Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid, each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area. And so it's really hard to say, what is the area of an asteroid? Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature. What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is. So we're gonna start out with the blue ones, which are spaced further apart. We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline. So we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline, and we're gonna do it over again. But this time we're gonna use the white pins, which are spaced closer together. So we measured the coastline again. And what do you think happens?","307":"yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids","308":"okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference","309":"so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials","310":"It's pretty amazing, right? Because it happened like a year or two ago. Our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past, but that record it created isn't perfect. So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?","311":"When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.","312":"Yeah, that's a great insight. Basically we can't remember everything. So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?","313":"That's a great way to think about it. Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time. So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?","314":"Yeah, you can see them all. And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles. But here's another question. You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree. So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?","315":"You have very good intuition. So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things. And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity. So what have you learned today about infinity?","316":"so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen","317":"okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is","318":"i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right","319":"it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny","320":"the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment","321":"So black holes, you describe them as huge. The interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy, but they're actually physically really small. What really matters is the density. Do you know what density is?","322":"I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.","323":"If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight. And if that's heavy enough, the core will not be able to stop collapsing, 'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel, it's run outta fuel. And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole.","324":"So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?","325":"It is taking other stuff, but the funny question was like, if I wanted to move your chair, you'd think it was really strange if I didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it. One of the things Einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it. What do you think of that idea?","326":"this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other","327":"yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people","328":"And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things. But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale. We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity. So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable. Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.","329":"And then the different chemicals in the cells. If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like. But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.","330":"It's still pretty easy, right? It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that. So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups. You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.","331":"Exactly, right? That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do. Say we even just move the cup over here. Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?","332":"You have to be close to it. You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.","333":"I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.","334":"And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.","335":"Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.","336":"Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.","337":"There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.","338":"So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.","339":"Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.","340":"Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that. It's called the Domain Name System. The DNS's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.","341":"That's 98% true. And if you own a network, like you're att.com, or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right? So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network. The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control. There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers. It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.","342":"Exactly, right. And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home. So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.","343":"Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?","344":"So it's not quite as solid as the apple, but it's also not quite as two dimensional as the original sheet of paper. And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?","345":"But if you take a more interesting shape, some kind of fractal shape, like let's say the coastline of great Britain and you start doing this box, counting experiment, something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller, the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line.","346":"Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics.","347":"I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist. For me, infinite objects absolutely exist. And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.","348":"What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.","349":"Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know, what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning. On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory, a memory of something that we saw yesterday, like what we did or what we ate or where we were. But a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many, many, many experiences.","350":"I think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live? How does it get updated based on experiences? Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not? There are actually people who are born without a hippocampus. They have disruptions to episodic memories. They have trouble after this conversation remembering what the conversation was about, but they do have pretty good semantic information. They have a good sense of knowledge about the world. And that's interesting for two reasons. One, it shows this association between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory, episodic memories and semantic memory. The other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory, that we encounter one dog and then another dog, and then another dog and then we learned the concept, the semantic notion of a dog. And these people, their profile suggests that you can learn semantic information. You can learn general knowledge about the world, even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories.","351":"Yeah it looks really blocky. And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games, but also colors and textures. And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are gonna go. What they're gonna look at, how close they're gonna get to various objects. So fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely, you know, nice details you get closer and closer and closer. And so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail. One of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor. What's recursion?","352":"So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.","353":"Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen, but all my computer can do is draw straight lines. And that's actually too true of GPUs. It's kind of interesting. GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle. And so if we keep doing this with our paper, you kind of get pretty quickly the idea of what's gonna happen. So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance, every surface has been subdivided down. So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel.","354":"Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.","355":"Wow. Great question. Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable. So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second. That's pretty fast, right? Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.","356":"The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.","357":"That's really what we call the first hop. It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in. You go over a wireless connection. Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.","358":"Ah, another great question. There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet. Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device. And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth. And they're reordered for you. Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again? And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again. The other is the internet protocol. If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it. So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it. It says, This is going to Jenna. It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device. Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet. It's totally amazing, right? Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol. That was a great question.","359":"One thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us, like feeding yourself broccoli, so second nature to us, are really hard for robotics. When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles.","360":"So over the past four levels, we've been talking about Moravec's paradox. I'm curious to get your perspective. There are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time.","361":"Yeah. It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.","362":"So I study spins. And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state. And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.","363":"So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.","364":"So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing. It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states. Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one. So switch is either on or off. Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition. So it can be partially on and partially off. But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us. In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.","365":"In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.","366":"So some ways, you know, when atomic clocks were designed and built, we didn't necessarily think of GPS, but technology often works that way is that, there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says, hey, this is a great tool for some other application.","367":"Our topic today is quantum sensing. So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring. So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses. So do you know what your five senses are?","368":"Touch, exactly. So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right? In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see. Let me show you. Can you see inside it with your eyes?","369":"You wouldn't be able to see into the middle. If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open. That would then, you'd still have your ball. We could still play with it.","370":"For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening. Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it. We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately. And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us. But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.","371":"What would you guys do? You'd probably first get together and like, figure out some secret code, right? And then like, write messages to each other in that code. But what if you've never met the person before? What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before? How could we possibly do that?","372":"But it's not. You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box. We would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things. You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics. And then, I could prove to you that I know the key, I could open it up, and send it back to you. That way I would be proving to you that I know the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox. So based on what we've discussed today, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.","373":"Yeah, and probably nobody is. Have you heard a lot in your studies about these super massive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy?","374":"There might be many alternate routes. It might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes. Like, we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities.And so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases. And I think the interesting thing is, with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud, is to wonder if we're gonna merge.","375":"But when we do merge with Andromeda, presumably our black holes will merge and Andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center. And then we'll have this just gigantic-","376":"We work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries. So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet, astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star, like a neutron star, and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light, that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet. And so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous.","377":"Exactly. Right. Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want. Right. We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized, to actually hide the information that we wanna hide. How have you used your knowledge in the projects that you've worked on? What are the challenges that you find?","378":"And also in the blockchain space, for example, if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs, if that could be done in a distributed way, then that would be great. One of the hopes that I have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful.","379":"It's a great analogy. You know I remember when I first learned of your work, for me as somebody who studies learning and memory, which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale of human thought than anything we had before.","380":"Getting way out there, but, but it is a way in which if you have the right model, it should be an efficient one. I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is, in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion. Would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it?","381":"So actually, in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero-knowledge proofs being implemented. And I think it's just the beginning. Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs. At its core, a zero-knowledge proof is an interaction between two people. Then I should be able to convince you that some statement is true, but you won't have any idea why it's true.","382":"Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.","383":"Right? So now, of course, one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you, but that would be revealing information to you. I don't wanna do that. So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around. And now, let's change up these colors. Can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal two of the colors again.","384":"But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.","385":"Exactly. Right. But it works for this coloring that I'm showing you right now. So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together. And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times. And if I correctly showed you different colors, each thousand times, you'd be really convinced. And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.","386":"One great example is like in elections. If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted. That every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total, in zero-knowledge, then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person. And yet everyone could see that, hey, yeah, it was done correctly.","387":"So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once. When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?","388":"You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions. So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals. And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers. This is trans-finite induction. It would work for any ordinal. So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers. And this allows us to prove some crazy things. Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions. So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one. So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.","389":"So a fractal is something that we see every day, but it's a little bit hard to describe. It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away, or you look at it really up close, it has kind of a similar appearance. And actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction.","390":"And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today. In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal. A tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree.","391":"So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.","392":"Yeah, it's a ton of work. If you think about Moana's island, it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it. And that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules, like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really, really fast.","393":"Like coding, exactly. That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush. So in your own words, how would you describe a fractal to somebody?","394":"We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device. What are the typical data rates for IoT devices? I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.","395":"it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing","396":"And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.","397":"So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?","398":"We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.","399":"Yeah. So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out. When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?","400":"Or you don't even need computers. Like I remember when I was a kid, I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh, what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself, you're gonna start hearing this kind of fractal sound, right? So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?","401":"Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality. But it's kind of interesting because I think if I think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way, they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world.","402":"Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know, it's not really about these exotic examples. Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever. Yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities, but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable. And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know, never sat down and you know, thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that. But it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist.","403":"And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?","404":"Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.","405":"There you go, there is your decision. Okay, you can take those. It took you some time there. You looked like you were really working hard at that problem. And that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally, some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options. But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite. One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it. And so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information.","406":"I love math for the same reason. Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called zero-knowledge proof. So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people. There's a prover and a verifier. And I wanna prove that something is true to you. But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why. I remember when I first heard about it, I was like, wait, what? How can that possibly be? Right?","407":"But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?","408":"So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.","409":"When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?","410":"What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?","411":"Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer, he wouldn't learn anything. Because even the computer doesn't learn anything. So Chelsea, in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof?","412":"It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems. And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems. So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?","413":"Yeah, exactly. One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors. And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle. And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?","414":"So do you think you can integrate multiple NV centers or multiple optical sensors? So are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many NVs I can pack into a certain region?","415":"Right. People bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche field. I remember in physics, you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments, completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages.","416":"Yeah, that's absolutely right. So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics. There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million. So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set. So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera. That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set. And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set. But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.","417":"Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.","418":"They can't live together. That would be a great solution. I don't know. I think these people don't really get along. So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away. So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two. So that's creating one new space for us. And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four. Are you starting to see a pattern here?","419":"Infinity, great. Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.","420":"Matilda. All right. We're gonna actually build an internet. I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you, or a couple of toys, actually. Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?","421":"That's right. So that's pretty cool. There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together. And that's something we actually call routing.","422":"Exactly. So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built. And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?","423":"Lettuce go on. [Skylar and Jim laughing] A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right? The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.","424":"We're in level five now. So you're the expert-expert. I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then.","425":"So a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die, if they're heavy enough, they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole. So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star. And what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star. Literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole. But let's say both those stars formed black holes. And what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum. They create literally waves in the shape of spacetime as they're moving. So imagine mallets on a drum, how the drum ripples. Depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds. So effectively these black holes, as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together, they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second. It's this really crazy event, but it's happening in complete darkness. Eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they wring out, the spacetime's going crazy around them, it's this storm in spacetime, and they settle down to a quiet black hole. Then those waves that they created travel through the universe, basically undisturbed. For a long time people thought, well, even if black holes are out there, they're impossible to observe. And then they got very clever. You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes, that sounds crazy. So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help. This demo involves an electric guitar. Do you play at all?","426":"That's the computer science brain thinking right there. So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets. So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set. We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms. So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.","427":"I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?","428":"Maybe two. Why not? Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives. We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two. And do you see a pattern?","429":"Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.","430":"Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.","431":"Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line. Do you think that's the same size infinity?","432":"So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.","433":"Really glad you asked me that. There's a practical implication for computer science. Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine. So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time? He defined a real number to be computable< if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time. And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable. So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.","434":"and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing","435":"if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right","436":"so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution","437":"so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them","438":"there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question","439":"i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out"},"dialogue":{"0":"Explainer: Yeah. The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature. So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example. Okay. You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","1":"Explainer: Yeah. so this is the note F.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","2":"Explainer: F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11.

So you say you can see yourself on the chess board. Who is Irina on the chess board?\nExplainee: Yeah, well, I think Irina is a fighter. You know, Irina is not someone who likes to give up. Irina is someone who wants to leave everything on the board, right? Like every last drop. That's the idea.

So there's a relationship between motion through space, the earth is going through space, and the passage of time. They're kind of connected\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","9":"Explainer: in some way. But there are differences, right? If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right? Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space. Can you move over to that location? And can you come back? Anything getting in your way?

But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies.\nExplainee: We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","15":"Explainer: And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes.

All right. The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right? It's kind of like space. It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\nExplainee: Why though?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","18":"Explainer: So let me draw spacetime. Here's how we usually draw it. I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay? So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","19":"Explainer: When people ask me can you travel through time? I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later. So that's just this. Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not. So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there. So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","20":"Explainer: And it's almost exactly like the space story. The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves. Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time. It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch.\nExplainee: So it's kind of like our fundamental time? Or our base time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","21":"Explainer: And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there.\nExplainee: Why is that, that this one's shorter then?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","22":"Explainer: [Sean] That's the difference.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","23":"Explainer: So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside. What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them. They're giving it a different geometry.\nExplainee: Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","24":"Explainer: Nano is kind of a funny word, right? It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion. What's the smallest object you can think of?\nExplainee: A baby ant?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","25":"Explainer: A baby ant? Very good. So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you. And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000. There's all these little lines on the ruler. And each of those little lines is one millimeter. So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters. So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer. Tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainee: Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","26":"Explainer: You are definitely a second grader! [laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way. A unicorn would be awesome.\nExplainee: Why do you study stuff so small?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","27":"Explainer: Same with, who are the actors? It's not just people anymore. It's machines.\nExplainee: [Valentinas] Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","28":"Explainer: We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too. What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?\nExplainee: So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks. So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","29":"Explainer: Yeah. One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost. But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target.\nExplainee: Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense. Right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","30":"Explainer: Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","31":"Explainer: So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism. You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","32":"Explainer: And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995.\nExplainee: So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","33":"Explainer: So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful.\nExplainee: For sure, right, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","34":"Explainer: And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices. So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one.\nExplainee: So, it's kind of a trade-off?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","35":"Explainer: There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work. And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure. This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this.\nExplainee: Interesting.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","36":"Explainer: And sleep science. Do you sleep?\nExplainee: I do, I try. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","37":"Explainer: But being off is not just being off. There's lots of things that are happening. We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","38":"Explainer: So our sleep is made up of different types, okay? The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay? Or NREM. And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. And those are the two main types of sleep that happen. The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night.\nExplainee: Okay. Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","39":"Explainer: Okay? When do you think you experience the most REM?\nExplainee: Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep. And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","40":"Explainer: You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep. Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","41":"Explainer: One to six hours? That's a long nap.\nExplainee: It is a long nap.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","42":"Explainer: You probably have learned in school about three states of matter.\nExplainee: Solid, liquid and gas.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","43":"Explainer: Absolutely, we take the gas, and we add heat, and we get a plasma. And a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas. If we break down that gas, and we add enough energy to ionize it, where you can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them, and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around, that's the plasma. And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning. So you've already seen a plasma in fact. So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration. You've probably seen one of these before, right?\nExplainee: That's so cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","44":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly, perpendicular. And if I drive the current in this green wire, which direction will it go?\nExplainee: [Points counter-clockwise.]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","45":"Explainer: Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular. Now this is a bit of a trickier one. The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action. And so by changing the current in the blue coil, we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the tokamak. And now think back to how the wires worked. If I have a current going like this, where's the magnetic field?\nExplainee: That way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","46":"Explainer: Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak. We can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak. So our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut.\nExplainee: What could the tokamak be used for in like real life?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","47":"Explainer: Do you have any idea about any of the challenges? Like why has it taken us so long to get to fusion?\nExplainee: Making a star on earth is not easy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","48":"Explainer: Or we're gonna call the pushback a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision. So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium, and I try and combine them together, those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other. So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy, and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures. So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius. And we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron vault. And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.\nExplainee: Uh huh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","49":"Explainer: So that's very, very hot temperature. But the other thing we need is a lot of particles. That's the density. We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures, at lower energies than other fuel. And this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse, there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics, and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.\nExplainee: Compared to just hydrogen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","50":"Explainer: We've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on, that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma. So you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction? So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton, and so they combine in a fusion reaction, and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. But the neutron doesn't have any charge.\nExplainee: Yeah, it comes out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","51":"Explainer: And so, how much do you think you need?\nExplainee: I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","52":"Explainee: I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician. I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","53":"Explainer: This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover.\nExplainee: Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","54":"Explainer: Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide.\nExplainee: That's cool, yeah. What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough? Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","55":"Explainer: And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","56":"Explainer: The system we have today is also broken. (laughs) Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","57":"Explainer: In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future. Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it. It should be perfect. There should be zero car deaths.\nExplainee: (laughs) Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","58":"Explainer: [Sean] What kind of science?\nExplainee: I like biology and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","59":"Explainer: All right, you're in the wrong place. [laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science. So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions. Do you know what dimension is? How we would define dimensions?\nExplainee: I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","60":"Explainer: Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera. So let's do a little experiment here. So there's one dimension. I'll give that to you. Now, here's your task. I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other. It's easy to do. Yeah, so there's no trick here.\nExplainee: [laughing] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","61":"Explainer: I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay. Now this is going to be slightly trickier. I'm going to give you this. I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time.\nExplainee: Um ...\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","62":"Explainer: There you go. So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right? Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space. I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time.\nExplainee: Um ...\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","63":"Explainer: That's right. So that's exactly what these would be. Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","64":"Explainer: Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance. And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","65":"Explainer: So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates. It's a different coordinate system. What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions. Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?\nExplainee: Time?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","66":"Explainer: [Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?\nExplainee: [Juliana] Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","67":"Explainer: Absolutely right. And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in.\nExplainee: Oh. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","68":"Explainer: Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","69":"Explainer: That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple.\nExplainee: It isn't.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","70":"Explainer: Huh.\nExplainee: Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","71":"Explainer: Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons.\nExplainee: I'd like to think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","72":"Explainer: And less and less confident, which is an emotion which the computer doesn't feel.\nExplainee: One thing that we noticed when I was talking with a colleague of mine, his name is Ashton Anderson. He's a professor at University of Toronto. He was in my lab, and we both had this passion for chess, but we realized no one had really used AI to play like a human would play.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","73":"Explainer: Yeah, you'd have to move your king.\nExplainee: Get to my king, and so I remember hitting all these variations that just scared me.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","74":"Explainer: That haunted me for days.\nExplainee: (Herbie laughs)\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","75":"Explainer: Something like that. And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here. But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along.\nExplainee: And it makes like a pull.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","76":"Explainer: I've been using this tune Amazing Grace.\nExplainee: Oh, right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","77":"Explainer: Do you know what computer hacking is?\nExplainee: It's bad. Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","78":"Explainer: What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place.\nExplainee: So they put like a protection account or something.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","79":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. They're looking for ways that they can create protection. It's kind of like the lock on your front door. That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder.\nExplainee: What would they do about the people and the broken lock?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","80":"Explainer: In many cases, they'll send them a new lock. So it's an upgraded, better version. Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well.\nExplainee: But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","81":"Explainer: I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","82":"Explainer: I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack. I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look.\nExplainee: But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","83":"Explainer: That's entirely possible. They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","84":"Explainee: Hello Donna, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","85":"Explainer: You could not convince me to stay, no.\nExplainee: But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","86":"Explainer: And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","87":"Explainer: Sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorithms. So, how does one actually research algorithms or invent algorithms?\nExplainee: The most important way is just trying to think about inefficiencies, and also think about connecting threads. The way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something, but it's about doing something efficiently. Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now. Google, I would say for example, is learning every day about like, Oh what articles, what links might be better than others? And re-ranking them. There are recommender systems all around us, right? Like content feeds and social media, or you know, like YouTube or Netflix. What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","88":"Explainer: That's a nice way of looking at it. So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage.\nExplainee: That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image. It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","89":"Explainer: Right, exactly. And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface.\nExplainee: Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done. So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","90":"Explainer: Oh, that's pretty cool. What do you know about computer hacking?\nExplainee: I don't really know much about computer hacking actually.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","91":"Explainer: So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that. Is that right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","92":"Explainer: Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing. Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software. You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs. Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?\nExplainee: [Linda] Space bar.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","93":"Explainer: Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device. It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me. Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer? You can give it information.\nExplainee: Camera.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","94":"Explainer: That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer. That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs. Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?\nExplainee: What inputs would you normally use to hack?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","95":"Explainer: Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right? I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods.\nExplainee: How long does it take to get in?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","96":"Explainer: What are you studying right now?\nExplainee: I'm doing physics and computer science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","97":"Explainer: If I take a film of that electron, and it's a little fanciful to describe it that language because you know about quantum mechanics and so forth, but I take a film of a little particle moving around, and I show you that film, you'll be really hard-pressed to determine whether I've shown you the film running forward in time or whether I've shown you the film going in reverse time. If I had two, or three, or four,or a gazillion particles into the mix, then it will be much easier for you to determine whether the film is going forward in time or backward in time. But order and disorder don't have much meaning if there's only one particle. And that's why the fundamental laws don't draw a distinction, but the macroscopic experience does, but it raises a key question. Where'd the order of the egg come from? If everything goes toward disorder, how did I get this orderly collection of atoms called an egg? Well, you probably would say from--\nExplainee: Chicken.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","98":"Explainer: Yeah, not only did we find that time changes with speed in special relativity, but we also found that time changes with gravity. Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field, or gravitational potential actually, that it is experiencing. I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","99":"Explainer: What's your idea what physics is?\nExplainee: Um, I'm not so sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","100":"Explainer: And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?\nExplainee: I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","101":"Explainer: Has its own unit, has one number.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","102":"Explainer: I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me. You're much better at this than I am.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","103":"Explainer: Well, as far as we know.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","104":"Explainer: Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?\nExplainee: That would be an amazing discovery. The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","105":"Explainer: So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?\nExplainee: I have. I took that last year.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","106":"Explainer: I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics. What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices. There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin. As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit. And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","107":"Explainer: Do you know what this is?\nExplainee: Carbon nanotube?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","108":"Explainer: Yeah. 100%. That's right. And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials. But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space. Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it. It's a real marvel in ingenuity.\nExplainee: I gotta ask. The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","109":"Explainer: What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?\nExplainee: It kind of seems very science fiction.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","110":"Explainer: Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology. Does this look familiar to you? Can you guess what this might be?\nExplainee: I don't know.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","111":"Explainer: I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor. And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation. You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?\nExplainee: You make it smaller?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","112":"Explainer: And how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time?\nExplainee: It's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","113":"Explainer: Even if it is a human-made concept that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time, ultimately giving rise to galaxy, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?\nExplainee: Yeah, my freshman year physics class.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","114":"Explainer: Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?\nExplainee: Yes, I heard about that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","115":"Explainer: Yeah, that's another interesting concept. It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right? If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right? You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN. That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network. Are you familiar with buffer overflows?\nExplainee: No, I am not familiar with that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","116":"Explainer: Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity.\nExplainee: Wow, that's amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","117":"Explainer: What's your name, tell me a little bit about yourself.\nExplainee: I'm Amelia, I'm nine years old. I'm in third grade, and my favorite subject at school is definitely science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","118":"Explainer: That's a good answer. Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right? How can we put a star in a jar? Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container. So fusion is about bringing things together. That's what fusing means. When those fusion reactions occur, a new particle is created, and energy is also released. Do you know what an atom is?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","119":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And I was also thinking on how can it do that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","120":"Explainer: You know, scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works, right? It'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist. Have you ever seen one of these games?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","121":"Explainer: That's a really great point.\nExplainee: How do you keep the invisible plasmas, because they're invisible? Do you keep 'em in one spot so you always know where they are.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","122":"Explainer: Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?\nExplainee: It rests your body, like an electric car.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","123":"Explainer: They're pretty cool, right?\nExplainee: Mhm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","124":"Explainer: And how did you feel?\nExplainee: Really tired.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","125":"Explainer: A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.\nExplainee: I could never do that, I would pass out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","126":"Explainer: So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?\nExplainee: Aww a dolphin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","127":"Explainer: A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right? And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?\nExplainee: How?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","128":"Explainer: Do you know a lot about lasers? Or just about the laser that you use.\nExplainee: Not a lot, just a little bit.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","129":"Explainer: Yes. And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell? Or to ionize it?\nExplainee: I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that. So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","130":"Explainer: You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably. But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated. That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time. I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years. Because it is going to take a lot of AI. Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do. Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic.\nExplainee: Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential. But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","131":"Explainer: So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull. And that makes sense. There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","132":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","133":"Explainer: Yeah, it would just go straight. But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?\nExplainee: It would just go down.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","134":"Explainer: You had that moment, I saw that it your face!\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","135":"Explainer: Isn't it kind of amazing?\nExplainee: Yeah. [laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","136":"Explainer: What do you know about algorithms?\nExplainee: Nothing really, at all honestly. I think it's just probably a way to store information in computers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","137":"Explainer: What if your friend happened to be at the very bottom of this randomly organized list? Why is that a problem? Like he or she's still there.\nExplainee: I guess it would take a while to get to while you're scrolling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","138":"Explainer: In what sense?\nExplainee: If he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","139":"Explainer: Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50\/50 probability, John could get sandwiched in between two pages. But does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out altogether?\nExplainee: Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","140":"Explainer: Okay, that's nice. So, you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway, or in this case near the J section of the book.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","141":"Explainer: Okay. So, I'm in the K section. Is John going to be to the left or to the right?\nExplainee: To the left.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","142":"Explainer: Yeah. So, John is going to be to the left or the right and what we can do here, though your phone does something smarter, is tear the problem in half, throw half of the problem away, being left with just 500 pages now. But what might I next do? I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again, but we've learned to do better. I can go roughly to the middle here.\nExplainee: And you can do it again.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","143":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. So, now maybe I'm in the E section, which is a little to the left. So, John is clearly going to be to the right, so I can again tear the problem poorly in half, throw this half of the problem away, and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages, now we've gone to 500, 250, now we're really moving quickly.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","144":"Explainer: And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically left with just one single page at which point John is either on that page or not on that page, and I can call him. Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a thousand pages then went to 500, 250, 125, how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?\nExplainee: 10.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","145":"Explainer: That's roughly roughly 10. Because in the first algorithm, looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through a thousand pages. But the second algorithm you said was 500, maybe 501, essentially the same thing. So, twice as fast. But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half, in half, in half, not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time. So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only. But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe, for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.\nExplainee: Oh, that's cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","146":"Explainer: [Donna] And what's your major?\nExplainee: I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math. I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","147":"Explainer: Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works. Our short pulses are made of different colors. So I've got a colored slinky here. We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped. The word chirped comes around because birds chirp. When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp. The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse. And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate. And so that was the laser hammer. So we can't have that in the laser. So the question is what could we do? The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material. So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast. The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back. And so the frequencies go hoo! Like this okay? So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse. And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse. And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer. When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.\nExplainee: So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","148":"Explainer: Absolutely. And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not. So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?\nExplainee: I'd probably look at certain keywords. Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","149":"Explainer: Yeah. This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why.\nExplainee: How can we improve machine learning algorithms?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","150":"Explainer: Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now? So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?\nExplainee: Uh, three?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","151":"Explainer: It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act. And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures. So how did you come to that? And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?\nExplainee: We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA. This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins. It's long and thin. So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter. And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time. Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors. And you can put a new piece of DNA in between. And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there. And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein. Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length. And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate. We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","152":"Explainer: Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?\nExplainee: The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis. And I think that we're really going that way. If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","153":"Explainer: It's what keeps us on the earth.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","154":"Explainer: The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down.\nExplainee: Nice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","155":"Explainer: Do you know why we're here today?\nExplainee: Because we're talking about science.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","156":"Explainer: Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?\nExplainee: Um, yes, I know that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","157":"Explainer: Which gives a clear sense of causality.\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","158":"Explainer: And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below? Do you Galileo?\nExplainee: I would say Galileo, Newton. Of course, the completion of this idea is Newton.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","159":"Explainer: Have you done any work in side channel analysis?\nExplainee: Like, a little bit. I read the Rowhammer paper. I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","160":"Explainer: That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right? If you wanna use a wireless router.\nExplainee: Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","161":"Explainer: Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right? Something that you actually own.\nExplainee: Yeah, I think that's nuts. I'm firmly against that for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","162":"Explainer: What if it were illegal? Would you then do it? Fortunately it's not today, right? It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean.\nExplainee: I don't know, probably, yeah. [laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","163":"Explainer: What have you been up to? And yeah, what are you working on?\nExplainee: Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis. So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer. So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life. You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","164":"Explainer: Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right? You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player. Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?\nExplainee: One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices. I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right? Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","165":"Explainer: The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur. Where do you think security is going or new research is going? Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?\nExplainee: Fault injection has become pretty interesting. Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest. Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback. Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right? For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward. You didn't need these crazy attacks. It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right? More than just a data sheet mentioned. There's actually something behind it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","166":"Explainer: Yeah, that's 100% correct. Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","167":"Explainer: [Jacob] Awesome. And why did you prefer that one?\nExplainee: Because it sounds better.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","168":"Explainer: But you learned about black holes?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","169":"Explainer: Yeah, if you are going to be able to change the past, that's the one that resonates most with me.\nExplainee: I think the same.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","170":"Explainer: Yeah, so that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables, where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox.\nExplainee: Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","171":"Explainee: Yeah, we do have an answer. So the simplest version of that is, imagine that the universe has a shape of a donut.\nExplainee: All right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","172":"Explainer: as they are when we teach to freshmen the special theory of relativity. That's right, exactly.\nExplainee: Me, for example.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","173":"Explainer: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainee: There's an eternity, but I'm never gonna see it, I'm never gonna feel it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","174":"Explainer: And also take all of their pieces.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","175":"Explainer: For me, I would describe chess as a lot of what you said, and also, it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four, five, six, seven moves like a plan, like a strategy. So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit. So if I said, Hey, you get three moves in a row, can you come up with a plan?\nExplainee: I think I could. If I have three moves in a row, I'd probably checkmate them with rook H3, queen H4, and then queen takes H7, checkmate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","176":"Explainer: I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with, right? You can bring your queen out this way or the rook. You can start with both, and then you come here and then you checkmate. But I did say white gets three moves in a row, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","177":"Explainer: But that's how we have to think about plans, right? We have to think about, Okay, well if I get a couple of moves in a row, what would I like to accomplish? What does my opponent want to do? So I'm not just gonna sit here and get checkmated hopefully. Right? So what do you think I want to do in this position?\nExplainee: I think my king is on a bad scale right now, so maybe you are trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","178":"Explainer: Oh, you're saying like if I take this pawn, maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal. See, that's very good vision. There's some pieces in the way, but yes. In chess, you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open. Do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open?\nExplainee: Usually when a position is closed, pieces are more squished together.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","179":"Explainer: Okay. Why do you think so?\nExplainee: Well, the black king is very exposed into the white side of the board, and like the white king is a bit more safe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","180":"Explainer: Yes, you're 100% right 'cause in chess, the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material, but then, like you said, who has the weaker king? And I would say my king has gone way too far, right? So there's a tactic here for what?\nExplainee: Maybe. Is it bishop takes upon on E4?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","181":"Explainer: Yes. Well done. And then I would take the pawn.\nExplainee: And then I would take the rook.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","182":"Explainer: What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?\nExplainee: At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity. And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries. And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery. We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can. And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","183":"Explainer: Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something.\nExplainee: It really is a testament to this kind of technology and how its developing and how over time its gonna just be, you're gonna be able to pack more pixel density in those displays and its gonna get a lot more immersive.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","184":"Explainer: Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make a pretty good video game out of it. Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing.\nExplainee: Yeah, a lot of freedom.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","185":"Explainer: That's a really good question. It's actually a way that we can trade. Do you know what trade is?\nExplainee: Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something. It's when you give up most of what you want, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","186":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","187":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of machine learning before?\nExplainee: I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","188":"Explainer: That's right. When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction. One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems. So do you have an artist that you really like?\nExplainee: Yeah, Melanie Martinez.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","189":"Explainer: All right. So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?\nExplainee: Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","190":"Explainer: It's a great question. The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand. So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples. Why do you think companies might use machine learning?\nExplainee: Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","191":"Explainer: What is a laser made out of? Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb. Right?\nExplainee: So it's a beam?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","192":"Explainer: That's right. All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot. And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area. But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in. See it doesn't really work does it?\nExplainee: So the laser needs ultimately many things. It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","193":"Explainer: Well it depends. So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail. You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible. And for that we use a lens. For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel. Okay so that force per unit area--\nExplainee: So it's kind of like a magnifying glass? Like it magnifies the light down to a point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","194":"Explainer: Exactly. You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length. But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.\nExplainee: Exactly.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","195":"Explainer: But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon. It's 300,000 kilometers long. So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated. The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper. So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them. 'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.\nExplainee: There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","196":"Explainer: Exactly. And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with. I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--\nExplainee: It funnels into--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","197":"Explainer: [Robert] Would you like to give it a try?\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","198":"Explainer: So you ready?\nExplainee: Yep.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","199":"Explainer: Okay. We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old. So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","200":"Explainer: It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane. Now we're ready for the magic. We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle. We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","201":"Explainer: Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated. We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher.\nExplainee: Okay, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","202":"Explainer: because it suddenly changes shape.\nExplainee: I have seen these before, my friends use these.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","203":"Explainer: Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model. If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","204":"Explainer: So, I've come here complete with a actual chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on it here. How would you tell a friend to sort these?\nExplainee: I think one of the first things we learned was something called bubble sort. It was kind of like focusing on smaller bubbles I guess I would say of the problem, like looking at smaller segments rather than the whole thing at once.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","205":"Explainer: Six five?\nExplainee: And then switch it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","206":"Explainer: All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point, we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up. Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","207":"Explainer: So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space. Do you ever wonder how we do that?\nExplainee: Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","208":"Explainer: Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up. But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth. Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down? It's actually not true. If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work. You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think of how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth? That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off. So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that.\nExplainee: And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","209":"Explainer: In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it. So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this? The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit. And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around. So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity. They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface.\nExplainee: It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","210":"Explainer: Yeah. You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?\nExplainee: Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","211":"Explainer: That's because in some sense, you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room.\nExplainee: Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","212":"Explainer: So let me tell you where it gets really crazy.\nExplainee: [Maria laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","213":"Explainer: So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving. Let's say you both see a flash of light. A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where. So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell. Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","214":"Explainer: The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically. If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","215":"Explainer: [Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?\nExplainee: It sounds like fun. What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place? Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","216":"Explainer: Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?\nExplainee: Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions. As you move in, there's something in the interior. It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions. Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","217":"Explainer: Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit? Or is this the real thing that they use? Yes, it is the real thing they use. We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified. Is this a familiar thing? I know things like this have been discussed, right?\nExplainee: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","218":"Explainer: Right. Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there. But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe? You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance.\nExplainee: Right. Good, good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","219":"Explainer: But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter. They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant. So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere.\nExplainee: Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","220":"Explainer: I know not everyone buys that, right?\nExplainee: Not everyone buys it. There's a big discussion in the literature right now.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","221":"Explainer: If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote.\nExplainee: Right, yes. I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","222":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: No, I don't think so.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","223":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","224":"Explainer: How long have you been playing chess?\nExplainee: I played a little bit of chess growing up against my brothers, but ever since the Queen's Gambit show came out, that's I think when I downloaded the app and started playing against friends for fun.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","225":"Explainer: So I'm going to look up your account. We're gonna pick a game and we're gonna analyze it.\nExplainee: Sounds good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","226":"Explainer: Yes, you definitely want to get the the bishop out, but you don't wanna move it just yet. So how do you do that?\nExplainee: I am not sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","227":"Explainer: One thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break? Can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board? If you have a low risk position, your position's just nice and comfortably better, you don't want chaos.\nExplainee: guess maybe they would try to advance their middle pawn.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","228":"Explainer: Yes. Yes. And this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your center, what else have I changed just by moving this pawn?\nExplainee: Now there bishop is activated.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","229":"Explainer: Yes. As you're trying to improve your middle game, one question you always have to ask yourself is, Is that trade good for me? Is it good for my opponent? It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork.\nExplainee: If I was black, I would advance the pawn because I think knowing that the black has two knights and I have two bishops, they would want more of a closed game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","230":"Explainer: Yep, here, yeah, and what else? What else did that move open up?\nExplainee: It opened up the E file for us.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","231":"Explainer: Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","232":"Explainer: Yeah, I like that, yeah.\nExplainee: Yeah, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","233":"Explainer: Do you know what gravity is?\nExplainee: It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","234":"Explainer: That's pretty good. So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us. But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much. You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","235":"Explainer: [Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth. But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth. We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us. All of those things are acting on you and me right now.\nExplainee: If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","236":"Explainer: Yes.\nExplainee: [Bonet screams] Ooh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","237":"Explainer: They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates. There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station. He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","238":"Explainer: Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size. Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","239":"Explainer: Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works. I don't actually think that's a true story, though.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","240":"Explainer: And a heavy object.\nExplainee: Oh my God. [Janna laughs]\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","241":"Explainer: What are they asking you about fusion?\nExplainee: So usually people ask me like, do you think that we'll ever really replace all of our other energy sources with fusion?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","242":"Explainer: I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it, because the fuel for fusion is a plasma, and we don't experience plasmas on earth in our everyday life.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","243":"Explainer: So they're plasmas which are held in a stable enough state by strong external magnetic fields confining the plasma into a donut shape. And this has a lot of advantages for us, because charged particles want to follow the magnetic field lines. But things start to get really interesting when we're no longer thinking about individual particle motions in the plasma. And instead we start to think about collective effects.\nExplainee: It's never occupied any space in my mind to think about what happens when you have something so high temperature and like precisely confined, and now you have to deal with presumably turbulence.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","244":"Explainer: I mean if people talk about simulating that system and following those particles, it's probably gonna take millions and millions of years on even the fastest supercomputer.\nExplainee: Uh-huh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","245":"Explainer: Absolutely, so it's a gyrokinetic model.\nExplainee: Gyrokinetic.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","246":"Explainer: So we average that out, we do a gyro average, because the motion is typically called a gyro frequency. That's how fast it goes around the field line.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","247":"Explainer: Great.\nExplainee: I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","248":"Explainer: So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.\nExplainee: Great.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","249":"Explainer: You haven't got to play with lasers. So I brought one. It's my friend's cat toy. Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","250":"Explainer: Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot. I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight. I brought a cute little one. So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?\nExplainee: Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","251":"Explainer: [Donna] And yet it's not. Isn't that amazing?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","252":"Explainer: One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it. But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go. You see it actually bending the corner?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","253":"Explainer: So this obviously is much bigger than our hair. Right?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","254":"Explainer: Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","255":"Explainer: A lot of origami is animals, birds and things. There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations. Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns.\nExplainee: Wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","256":"Explainer: The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet.\nExplainee: They weren't cut?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","257":"Explainer: There's no cuts in these just folding. We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?\nExplainee: How about like that?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","258":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold. In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys.\nExplainee: So all the folds are reversible?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","259":"Explainer: So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two.\nExplainee: Oh.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","260":"Explainer: That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates.\nExplainee: Twists?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","261":"Explainer: Do you know what machine learning means? Have you heard that before?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","262":"Explainer: What about this one?\nExplainee: A dog. A cat. I think, a cat? Because it's more skinny. And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","263":"Explainer: Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve. As long as you did all your practice, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","264":"Explainer: That's amazing. What made you decide to trade on eBay?\nExplainee: Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","265":"Explainer: And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right? We have a lot of banks.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","266":"Explainer: We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.\nExplainee: So how does it work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","267":"Explainer: So do you know what virtual reality is?\nExplainee: Yes, its simple. Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","268":"Explainer: That's actually a really good description. The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean.\nExplainee: Or in Minecraft.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","269":"Explainer: We're gonna talk about blockchain technology. Have you heard of blockchain?\nExplainee: I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","270":"Explainer: And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node. So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.\nExplainee: I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","271":"Explainer: Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square.\nExplainee: What?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","272":"Explainer: That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points. How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?\nExplainee: I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","273":"Explainer: Yeah, exactly. Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights. Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper. Here's our boundary. To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle. If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern. Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","274":"Explainer: The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this? There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it? Let's refold it and put the wings up. Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","275":"Explainer: You've got it, so you are ready to design origami.\nExplainee: Awesome.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","276":"Explainer: Can I explain a couple of them to you?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","277":"Explainer: So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU, or central processing unit. And those are the pieces of hardware that know how to respond to those instructions. Like moving up or down, or left or right, knows how to do math like addition and subtraction. And then there's at least one other type of hardware inside of a computer called memory or RAM, if you've heard of this?\nExplainee: I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","278":"Explainer: Let me get some supplies from the cupboard here. So, should we make an algorithm together?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","279":"Explainer: Okay, here we go. What would the next step be here?\nExplainee: Clean all this mess up.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","280":"Explainer: Exactly.\nExplainee: So, like if you type in just Google, then you won't find the answer to your question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","281":"Explainer: Good to see you again, Yue.\nExplainee: Yes, good to see you.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","282":"Explainer: So how strong is the link?\nExplainee: Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea. We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","283":"Explainer: So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right? So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?\nExplainee: Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","284":"Explainer: What's one of the most exciting parts of your research right now?\nExplainee: Something that we were not able to do until very recently was actually using first principle simulations to predict the performance and efficiency of reactors. The developments in plasma theory and computation and simulation, that has been thoroughly validated over the years, in many experiments, and now we're using those simulations to inform how to best operate our future reactors. It's very exciting because so far we've been getting great results. It's very, very promising.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","285":"Explainer: Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right? And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say. All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","286":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And then G.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","287":"Explainer: So as we move up the levels today, we wanna start introducing slightly more advanced terms. One of them is called initiative, but what exactly does that mean to you?\nExplainee: So like if you're in a battle, you win a certain like spot, right? A really important spot. That gives you initiative. When you get something, right, that you want, then it can start building up. It can start building up to be better and better and bigger and bigger.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","288":"Explainer: Would you say black has more initiative? Not yet.\nExplainee: Not yet, but considering the way I said it, it's like you follow up with something. So you just attacked me with that, and I move back. So you kind of, you have the initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","289":"Explainer: I really feel like this is a nice example of black has an initiative.\nExplainee: Yeah, black definitely has an initiative.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","290":"Explainer: You wanna end the game right now?\nExplainee: Yeah. Okay, let's see. What can I do? Okay, I'll do that. Okay, try and roll up the sleeves, okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","291":"Explainer: Connectome.\nExplainee: To be honest, I have no idea.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","292":"Explainer: So tell me, what do you know about black holes?\nExplainee: Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","293":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Is that an extra dimension? Does that fit into that, or is that something?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","294":"Explainer: It's a, yeah.\nExplainee: [Bela] Or how does that work?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","295":"Explainer: Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right? So you've heard of string theory?\nExplainee: I have. So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","296":"Explainer: Mm-hmm. So we have quantum mechanics, right? The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in. It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","297":"Explainer: [Sean] Do you know where it comes from?\nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","298":"Explainer: From membranes, you know. We have lines, one dimension. We have two dimensional surfaces. So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","299":"Explainer: If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane. Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while. But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things.\nExplainee: So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","300":"Explainer: Yes, string theory's even better. So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism. So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","301":"Explainer: being something that you can already predict. Right.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","302":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge. But people can't, sometimes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","303":"Explainer: Yeah.

I'm studying physics and environmental studies.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","305":"Explainer: And so you can't actually measure the length.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","306":"Explainer: Right? Yeah. So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is. It has some really, really interesting detail at all, scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes.\nExplainee: Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","307":"Explainer: is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","308":"Explainer: so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement\nExplainee: I have not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","309":"Explainer: so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers\nExplainee: They read like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","310":"Explainer: So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?\nExplainee: There was this pool, I love pools. And then there's a slide you go down and there's pool noodles in there too. And then there's a little tiny sandbox.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","311":"Explainer: Do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool?\nExplainee: I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or, or like sort of a teal.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","312":"Explainer: When you were telling me about the sandbox, it felt like you didn't have to make that guess, that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes. I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information.\nExplainee: I think as you get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things, which is why you forget stuff.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","313":"Explainer: So what do you know about infinity?\nExplainee: I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","314":"Explainer: I'll admit. I have absolutely no idea. Do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number?\nExplainee: Finite because I can see them all in here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","315":"Explainer: That's a wonderful question, a very rich question. What do you think?\nExplainee: I think maybe because you said it was unlimited.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","316":"Explainer: me too\nExplainee: Yeah, always when I'm trying to take a photo.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","317":"Explainer: have you ever heard of the word quantum \nExplainee: No.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","318":"Explainer: i'm going to start by telling you about something called superposition so i'm going to explain it using this giant penny\nExplainee: Heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","319":"Explainer: while it's spinning\nExplainee: That's crazy.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","320":"Explainer: but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated \nExplainer: that's so cool right \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","321":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole?\nExplainee: Jude.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","322":"Explainer: Here, let me show you something. I can ask how heavy it is.\nExplainee: It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","323":"Explainer: I can also ask how big it is, which is a question about its volume. If I make it smaller, then what's happening is it's becoming more dense. So imagine I crushed this really, really small. It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass, but it would be much more dense.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","324":"Explainer: Well, that's a really good question. So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough. So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second.\nExplainee: So if like the sun all collapsed on itself, it would form a black hole?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","325":"Explainer: So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark. Any light that veers too close will fall in, will not be able to make it back out again. If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole, the black hole's not touching it. Why does the light get pulled in? Why does that happen?\nExplainee: So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","326":"Explainer: yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is\nExplainee: An A\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","327":"Explainer: this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other\nExplainee: Zero, one.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","328":"Explainer: So sensing is really just about measuring stuff.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","329":"Explainer: Start to see the different cells\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","330":"Explainer: Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot. Something like stacking these two cups. Do you think that's easy or hard?\nExplainee: If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","331":"Explainer: And then program the robot to move over here and open the- \nExplainee: And drop it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","332":"Explainer: So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect. So you can actually see a single electron. In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.\nExplainee: In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","333":"Explainer: [Sekhar] Yeah.\nExplainee: And those are very sensitive to fluctuations. Yeah. I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","334":"Explainer: I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources. In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.\nExplainee: Oh, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","335":"Explainer: And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there. And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.\nExplainee: But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","336":"Explainer: I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet. Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?\nExplainee: I have not heard of ARPANET.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","337":"Explainer: Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Actually, it was called ARPA at the time. They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network. Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.\nExplainee: So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","338":"Explainer: There's a lot big, right? And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable. Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network. So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.\nExplainee: Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","339":"Explainer: So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network. And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it. And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.\nExplainee: Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","340":"Explainer: Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right? You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist. We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. The API for the internet is something called a socket. And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts. If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.\nExplainee: I will be remembering that. [Jim laughs] I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","341":"Explainer: Okay. What does that mean?\nExplainee: No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","342":"Explainer: Where do they get dropped, do you think?\nExplainee: Somewhere in their travel process.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","343":"Explainer: And why three?\nExplainee: I would also say three.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","344":"Explainer: Totally, now, as a little experiment, take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball. So what is it? Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?\nExplainee: Because it has the pipes and the width. And there's a depth to it as well.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","345":"Explainer: And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line.\nExplainee: two\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","346":"Explainer: Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right? Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic.\nExplainee: Oh, you mean like perlin noise?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","347":"Explainer: It can be generative for sure.\nExplainee: It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","348":"Explainer: So what are you studying these days?\nExplainee: Well, I'm preparing my dissertation. The general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli, like different people's faces and make judgements about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","349":"Explainer: What I love about what you were describing is like you didn't use the word memory, were how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of that.\nExplainee: Oh of course.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","350":"Explainer: Some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in, in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right?\nExplainee: As far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling from memory is deciding what your emotional response was.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","351":"Explainer: What happens in Minecraft if you get really, really close to a shape?\nExplainee: Well, it just looks like a block.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","352":"Explainer: They're easy for a computer to execute, right? It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again. We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need. When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics. The example I think is subdivision surfaces. Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at all?\nExplainee: The name doesn't really ring a bell.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","353":"Explainer: So subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape. So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges. And so the question is how can I get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons? What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time, the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular. I still have these really sharp points.\nExplainee: Right why are we doing this?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","354":"Explainer: So you're a student in high school, is that right?\nExplainee: Yes, I'm a sophomore.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","355":"Explainer: Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet. I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood. You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System. And so the internet is a lot like that. It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.\nExplainee: How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","356":"Explainer: We could talk about that by analogy to a road system. It's not just one big, super highway. It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected. And those interchanges are what are called routers. That's where the links come together. You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia. So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.\nExplainee: So there is an underseas cable?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","357":"Explainer: The underseas cables are so cool! They're these big cables that are laid down by switches. They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.\nExplainee: How do you connect wirelessly?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","358":"Explainer: Ah, you said they're all in one spot. In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix. And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you. Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.\nExplainee: So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","359":"Explainer: What are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks?\nExplainee: So, I was really interested in the problem of scooping peas on a plate. They're relatively homogenous, but when it came to more complex foods, like broccoli, or deformable foods, like tofu, that can crumble, that gets a lot more complex to simulate.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","360":"Explainer: So great to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming.\nExplainee: It's my pleasure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","361":"Explainer: Cool. What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?\nExplainee: I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","362":"Explainer: It would be the top tier.\nExplainee: What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","363":"Explainer: Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.\nExplainee: So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","364":"Explainer: So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system. So you mentioned quantum computing earlier. So have you heard of the idea of superposition?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","365":"Explainer: It's more precise, Absolutely.\nExplainee: Okay. Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","366":"Explainer: In some ways, it is and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences. In fact, our old GPS system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks. They're a set of satellites, each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a timestamp and so, once it gets a signal from three different satellites, it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are. Now, if you could make those clocks even more precise, you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately.\nExplainee: Okay, that's really cool.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","367":"Explainer: What's your name?\nExplainee: Namina.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","368":"Explainer: Mm-hmm.\nExplainee: Yeah, and touch.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","369":"Explainer: But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right? Just.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","370":"Explainer: That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing. We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","371":"Explainer: Suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","372":"Explainer: It sounds impossible. Right?\nExplainee: It does.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","373":"Explainer: Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?\nExplainee: I'm a second year. So I'm measuring star formation histories in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","374":"Explainer: [Janna] Yeah.\nExplainee: We spend all of our time, when we learn about black holes in school, predominantly through star collapse.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","375":"Explainer: Yes, they're all friends.\nExplainee: Gravitationally, all friends.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","376":"Explainer: Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said, the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive. So our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole.\nExplainee: Supermassive black hole.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","377":"Explainer: Indeed.\nExplainee: But once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that, suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","378":"Explainer: No doubt. And especially with cloud computing, exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero-knowledge proofs, and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs, would be amazing.\nExplainee: Yeah. Absolutely.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","379":"Explainer: It'd be great to just start by talking about your work at the broadest level. To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.\nExplainee: I've been really interested in how past understandings of the brain have really focused on, on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does. But I think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain, which is between one region and another. So it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information. But I think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and computer science are under the umbrella of, of network science. So that is a science of networks, a science of understanding how bits of a system are interconnected with one another. Not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species, but we can ask even within a single person, how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another? How does the information flow change? I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this. Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed. They change over long timescales and it's similar to the brain. We really only create large scale connections over long timescales. But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily. And that's similar to what we do in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond to our environment.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","380":"Explainer: Memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build the model starts generating new predictions. Exactly the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information, right? I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing. And that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience, if our models of neuroscience were good enough, that book should shrink back. We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction. And so you don't need to store all those separate memories. You need to construct them. But if you have a good model, let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory. But really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details. It's kind of like the matrix, you know.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","381":"Explainer: Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?\nExplainee: Only in passing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","382":"Explainer: All right. Sounds good. Right? Here we have green, right? And over here, we have blue. Okay. And as you can see, they're two different colors.\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","383":"Explainer: Right? So you have a little bit of confidence, right, that I have managed to color this correctly. but not that much confidence. 'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","384":"Explainer: Nice. And that's smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had. Right?\nExplainee: Mm-hmm.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","385":"Explainer: But as you'll see, now it's not green, it's blue. And this one on the other hand, is green. Okay. The colors I showed you last time, don't work with these new colors, right? This wouldn't have worked before.\nExplainee: Yeah, because of this one, right?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","386":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: And it's implementations?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","387":"Explainer: And a choice function does what exactly?\nExplainee: Yeah, that's a good question.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","388":"Explainer: So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice. The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element. So that ordering is not a well ordering. So here's the key question. Do you believe the axiom of choice?\nExplainee: I do believe the axiom of choice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","389":"Explainer: Have you heard of fractals before?\nExplainee: No, absolutely not.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","390":"Explainer: So somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.\nExplainee: Yes.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","391":"Explainer: It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is itself another tree. So our rule is that every branch splits into two smaller branches.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","392":"Explainer: So your tree is totally beautiful, but it took a long time to make, right. How would you feel if I said, now you have to make a thousand of those trees.\nExplainee: I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","393":"Explainer: On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals, then you might need to learn a little bit about programming. [Keenan] Programming. Yeah.\nExplainee:  Programming.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","394":"Explainer: That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that. You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.\nExplainee: Right, exactly. I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","395":"Explainer: so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing\nExplainee: I'm a theoretical physicist. I started out in condensed matter theory, the theory that studies superconductors and magnets and I had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas. One of the nice things about being a theorist Is you get to keep learning new things.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","396":"Explainer: Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.\nExplainee: Right.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","397":"Explainer: And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do. But it turns out that it's actually the opposite. I wanna try a little demo.\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","398":"Explainer: So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand. So that was pretty easy, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","399":"Explainer: We're gonna make this a little bit harder now. So, can you put these on? And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed. There you go. Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better. So close your eyes.\nExplainee: Oh, there we go.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","400":"Explainer: Yeah for sure.\nExplainee: Just because I was so excited, you know? So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes. A kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","401":"Explainer: [Keenan] Right?\nExplainee: And when everybody understands scaling.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","402":"Explainer: So- He made a lot of happy little trees.\nExplainee: I think in that case, it came down to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things. I mean, in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic, Bob Ross. You know? So- \nExplainer: {missing part}\n","403":"Explainer: What do you know about memory?\nExplainee: I know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it, like in your head you can imagine it. I remember yesterday I got like orange juice, but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh, that day I got water.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","404":"Explainer: And on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind. And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong. In what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful?\nExplainee: Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","405":"Explainer: Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us, which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad. And if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past, that can help us make decisions about what to do next time. So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this, but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are. So you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick, you actually get to take with you.\nExplainee: I wish I could say both, but I guess I'll go with pixie sticks.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","406":"Explainer: What's your favorite subject?\nExplainee: I'd say math. Some of the small problems can actually be really big and complicated. It's like a puzzle.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","407":"Explainer: I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you. Do you believe me? You're not sure to believe me. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","408":"Explainer: But what if I could prove to you that I know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is? Let me show you. I took that photo that we showed you. And I put it behind this poster here. Why don't you go take a look through that hole?\nExplainee: I see the puffin.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","409":"Explainer: So when you look at this board, we don't know where the photo was, right? Was the photo like with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side. Or was the photo with the corner here? In which case the puffin would be on the other side. So this is a really simple example of a zero-knowledge proof. I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was, but you didn't learn anything else.\nExplainee: Why do you study zero-knowledge proof?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","410":"Explainer: When I first learned about them, I just thought they were so cool. But it turns out they're also really useful, not just for finding like, puffins. If you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer, they can just get your password. Right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","411":"Explainer: What if instead, we could somehow use a zero-knowledge proof to log in. You would just be able to prove that, hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them. If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?\nExplainee: Yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","412":"Explainer: Yeah. That's what it's called.\nExplainee: Yeah. yeah, I haven't heard of it before.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","413":"Explainer: Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?\nExplainee: I think of like coordinates.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","414":"Explainer: Right.\nExplainee: But I don't know that there's necessarily a limit. I mean, it keeps expanding. I mean, I think that there are some groups that are able to identify, you know, 30, 40 individual nuclear spins around a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","415":"Explainer: Yeah.\nExplainee: And that I think is gonna make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years, is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","416":"Explainer: What does infinity mean to you?\nExplainee: Really anything that has no end to it.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","417":"Explainer: Room number one. Exactly. I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity. What happens if we had a second guest?\nExplainee: Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","418":"Explainer: Absolutely. So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex. That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.\nExplainee: They can't live together?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","419":"Explainer: Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time. So I'm doubling the room number in fact. So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity. So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?\nExplainee: Infinity.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","420":"Explainer: Got a favorite movie?\nExplainee: Matilda.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","421":"Explainer: Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here. How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?\nExplainee: Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","422":"Explainer: Yeah. So that's a really good observation. In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen. We want to take what's called a shortest path. But still, there are multiple paths. And why do you think that might be valuable?\nExplainee: Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","423":"Explainer: Lettuce.\nExplainee: Lettuce who?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","424":"Explainer: So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.\nExplainee: Good to see you, Jim.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","425":"Explainer: Have you heard about black holes?\nExplainee: Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small. I know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes, like, around the universe and how it's made.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","426":"Explainer: Calculus involves the study of functions. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined. What would you say a function is?\nExplainee: I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","427":"Explainer: Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set. And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size. So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics. So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set. So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers. Both of these are infinite sets. Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?\nExplainee: Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","428":"Explainer: I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity. And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor. What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers. Start by matching zero with zero and one with one. But then we wanna include the negatives in the list. So which natural number would we match with negative one?\nExplainee: Maybe two.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","429":"Explainer: So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically. What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice. So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots. So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away. And this process could continue, but maybe by now you see the pattern, though it'd be a little bit difficult to describe as a function.\nExplainee: Oh is it for each rational number, there's a pair of integers that represent that rational number?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","430":"Explainer: Yeah, that's exactly right. And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number. That's what's going on with this counting. And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.\nExplainee: So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","431":"Explainer: Exactly. That's exactly right. So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers. What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity. Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.\nExplainee: That's wild.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","432":"Explainer: Great. That's exactly right. So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\nExplainee: Oh wow.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","433":"Explainer: So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity. On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality. While there are other infinities that are larger. So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.\nExplainee: I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","434":"Explainer: i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right\nExplainee: Certainly, depending on the complexity of your model then computational speed is one thing.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","435":"Explainer: and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing\nExplainee: Sure, yeah.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","436":"Explainer: you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down\nExplainee: Sure.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","437":"Explainer: yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers\nExplainee: So how do we actually encode it to start with?\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","438":"Explainer: the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic\nExplainee: Okay.\nExplainer: {missing part}\n","439":"Explainer: yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one\nExplainee: Yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful.

actually, the solution often lies in understanding the underlying structure and relationships within the harmonic series. By embracing the natural tendencies and tensions inherent in the overtone and undertone series, we can create more nuanced and organic harmonies, rather than just layering on more notes. The key is to really listen and feel the way the different elements of the harmonic series interact and complement each other.","1":"And this note, the one right above it, is the note C. Together, the F and C form a perfect fifth interval, which is a very common and stable harmonic relationship in music.","2":"That's a lot of musical terminology to unpack! Can you break down what you're trying to explain and how those different chords and keys are related? I want to make sure I understand the concepts you're trying to convey.","3":"The change from the brightness of A major to the more mellow quality of F major can create a sense of the sun going in, as you said. The shift in tonality can evoke a change in mood and atmosphere.","4":"Well, I think I see myself as a bit of a strategist on the board. I try to look at the big picture and plan several moves ahead, anticipating my opponent's responses. At the same time, I'm not afraid to take calculated risks and be aggressive when the situation calls for it. Like you said, I want to leave it all out there and fight for every point. It's about finding the right balance between strategy and tenacity.","5":"No, the Leningrad is a variation of the Dutch defense. The Dutch defense is a chess opening where Black defends the center by allowing White to occupy the center with pawns.","6":"Good idea. That will help control the center and strengthen the bishop's position.","7":"How did you first get interested in chess?","8":"So every time the Earth goes around the Sun, that's one year. And the Earth spins on its axis, and that's one day.","9":"But with time, it's not quite the same, is it? You can't just go back in time or move freely through it. Time seems to flow in one direction, forward, and we can't control it the way we can control our movements through space. What do you think about that?","10":"Okay, but what else can you tell me about him?","11":"All you need to do is imagine yourself in the future. Visualize what you want to be doing or where you want to be, and then let your mind transport you there. It's like a mental time machine!","12":"What do you mean by 'maybe'? Can you explain your thoughts on traveling to the future?","13":"No, I'm not doing EM anymore. I'm more interested in the neurological aspects of music performance and learning. The connectome, the neural pathways and connections in the brain, could play a significant role in how musicians develop their skills. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how the brain and body interact in musical training and performance.","14":"Exactly, that's the challenge we face. The X-ray binaries really swamp the signal from the black hole at the galactic center, making it very difficult to isolate and study the black hole itself. We have to find ways to disentangle the contributions from the various X-ray sources in order to get a clear view of the black hole.","15":"So in essence, the black hole is not something that's expelled or thrown out, it's simply the final state of the collapsed star, where all of the material just gets pulled in and becomes part of the black hole itself.","16":"So, in our universe, we perceive the three spatial dimensions of length, width, and height, as well as the fourth dimension of time. This four-dimensional spacetime is the fundamental framework of our reality, where events occur and objects exist and evolve over time.","17":"The reason they want you to think of spacetime as one four-dimensional thing is that space and time are actually interconnected. According to the theory of relativity, they're not separate entities, but part of a unified spacetime continuum. This means that the three spatial dimensions and the one temporal dimension are all part of the same fabric, and they can influence each other in significant ways.","18":"So this line here represents your trajectory through spacetime, right? Your path, your world line as it's called. And you can imagine other objects, other things, have their own world lines as they move through spacetime as well.","19":"So the idea is that we live in a 4-dimensional spacetime, with three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. And the paths we take through this 4-dimensional spacetime - that's what we call our trajectory or our world line. So when you travel in a rocket ship, you're following a different path through spacetime than if you just stayed on Earth. Does that make sense?","20":"Exactly! The proper time is the fundamental, base time that you would measure on your own clock or watch. It's the intrinsic time of the system you're observing, not time as measured by an external observer. So it's the true, underlying time of the process or event you're studying.","21":"The person who zoomed out experienced time dilation, meaning time passed more slowly for them compared to the person who stayed behind. This is a consequence of the theory of relativity, where the faster you move through space, the slower you move through time. So from the perspective of the person who stayed behind, the person who zoomed out appears to have aged less and become physically shorter.","22":"So in summary, a dimension is a measurable attribute or quantity that describes the size, shape, or position of an object. The number of dimensions an object has depends on how many independent variables are needed to fully specify its location or properties.","23":"Exactly! That's a great analogy. Imagine a stretched out sheet or trampoline, and if you place a heavy object like a bowling ball on it, it will create a dip or curvature in the surface. That's similar to how massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of spacetime around them, creating the gravitational effects we observe. The curvature of spacetime is what we interpret as gravity.","24":"That's a good guess! But actually, the smallest object we can think of is even smaller than a baby ant. Nano means one-billionth, so something that's 'nano' is even tinier than that. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter - that's how small we're talking about when we say 'nano'!","25":"Yes, that's exactly right! A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, which is even smaller than a millimeter. To put it in perspective, a single strand of human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide. Nanotechnology deals with materials and devices on the nanometer scale, which is truly minuscule compared to even the smallest things we can see with the naked eye.","26":"We study things that are incredibly small, like atoms and molecules, because they have amazing properties that we can use to create new and exciting technologies. Nanotech, or the study of things at the nanoscale, allows us to build things that are incredibly tiny, yet incredibly powerful.","27":"Blockchain technology has introduced a new type of actor in the digital landscape - machines. Rather than being limited to human participants, blockchain networks can facilitate transactions and interactions between autonomous software agents, devices, and even artificial intelligence systems. This shift in the nature of actors involved in digital processes is a significant aspect of the blockchain revolution.","28":"Absolutely, that's a really important point. The security and reliability of blockchain technology is a crucial concern that needs to be addressed. Blockchain networks have been susceptible to hacks and security breaches in the past, which has eroded public trust. Building stronger safeguards, robust authentication mechanisms, and greater transparency will be essential to overcome these trust issues and establish blockchain as a secure, reliable platform for various applications.","29":"Exactly. Educating users on the proper security measures and the decentralized nature of blockchain is crucial. Without that understanding, people may inadvertently expose their assets to risks. Blockchain technology is designed to be self-sovereign, so users need to learn how to manage their own private keys and secure their digital assets properly.","30":"That's where origami comes in. Origami techniques allow engineers to design complex structures that can be folded up compactly for launch, and then unfold in a precise, reliable way once in space. The origami-inspired designs help maximize the size and capabilities of these space systems without exceeding the size constraints of the rocket.","31":"So the goal in origami is often to try to achieve a specific final shape, and understanding these single degree of freedom mechanisms can help us figure out how to control the folding process to get the desired result. Do you have any other questions about the kinematics and constraints involved in origami folding?","32":"Exactly, that's right. Once the origami structure is deployed in space, the motorized mechanism only needs to actuate one of the folds to fully expand the entire solar array. The other folds unfold automatically due to the inherent properties of the origami pattern. This compact and efficient design allows us to maximize the surface area of the solar array while minimizing the launch volume, making it an ideal solution for space applications.","33":"Well, the challenge with origami is that the folding process introduces asymmetries and variations that make it difficult to achieve perfectly uniform results, even at larger scales. The nature of the material and the folding techniques inherently create some degree of variability.","34":"Exactly, it's a trade-off. The more asymmetric design packs more compactly, but the symmetric design opens more evenly. Depending on the specific application and requirements, one design may be preferable over the other. The key is understanding the tradeoffs and selecting the best option for your needs.","35":"This origami-inspired design is really fascinating. I'd love to hear more about the specific applications and the engineering challenges involved. How did the researchers come up with this concept, and what are some of the key design considerations they had to grapple with to make it work in practice?","36":"How well do you sleep? Do you have any sleep-related issues or concerns?","37":"For example, when you're asleep, your body goes through different stages of sleep. There's the lighter stages of sleep, where your brain is still somewhat active, and then there's the deeper stages of sleep, where your brain activity slows down and your body has a chance to rest and recharge.","38":"Absolutely! By measuring the different stages of sleep, including the amount of time spent in REM sleep, we can get a really good sense of someone's sleep patterns and quality. REM sleep is particularly important because it's associated with things like memory consolidation and emotional processing. So by looking at the timing and duration of REM sleep, we can get a sense of how well someone is sleeping and if there are any potential issues like sleep disorders.","39":"That's right, the use of technology, exposure to light, and noise can all disrupt your sleep and reduce the amount of REM sleep you experience. REM sleep is important for memory consolidation and emotional processing. So it's crucial to have good sleep hygiene and create an environment conducive to deep, restorative sleep. What other questions do you have about sleep and the importance of REM sleep?","40":"So, if you're not getting enough sleep overall, you're likely missing out on that essential REM sleep. That's when your brain really processes and consolidates all the information and experiences from the day. Not getting enough REM sleep can impact your mood, your cognitive function, and even your physical health in the long run.","41":"So, what's the ideal amount of sleep for a teenager like you?","42":"Exactly. Those are the three most common states of matter that we encounter in our everyday lives. But there's actually a fourth state of matter called plasma, which is a high-energy state where the atoms have been stripped of their electrons, creating a sea of charged particles.","43":"Okay, let me show you a demonstration of what a plasma looks like. Watch this!","44":"That's right, the magnetic field generated by the current in the green wire will be in the counter-clockwise direction, as you've indicated. This is an important principle in understanding how fusion reactors work, where the magnetic fields are used to confine and control the high-temperature plasma needed for the fusion reaction.","45":"Exactly, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the direction of the current, just like what we saw with the wire experiments. And as that magnetic field sweeps around the tokamak, it's going to induce a current in the plasma, which is what's going to heat it up and initiate the fusion process.","46":"Well, the tokamak is a key device for fusion energy research. The goal is to harness the same process that powers the Sun and other stars - nuclear fusion - to produce large amounts of clean, safe, and sustainable energy here on Earth. By confining a plasma using the three magnetic fields, we can create the conditions necessary for fusion reactions to occur and potentially generate electricity.","47":"What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate on the challenges involved in achieving fusion on Earth?","48":"So the key challenge with fusion is overcoming that Coulomb barrier, that electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. We have to give them enough energy to overcome that barrier and actually get them close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and fuse the nuclei together. That's why we need such high temperatures and energies to make fusion reactions happen.","49":"Exactly, compared to just regular hydrogen, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction has a higher probability of occurring when the particles get close enough. This is due to the unique nuclear structure and quantum mechanical properties of the deuteron and triton, which create a resonance effect that enhances the fusion cross-section at relatively lower temperatures and energies.","50":"That's right, the neutron doesn't have any charge, so it just goes straight through the magnetic field and deposits its energy into the surrounding structure or coolant system. The energy that we end up getting out is really from the kinetic energy of the helium nucleus, which is the other product of the fusion reaction. This helium nucleus has a lot of kinetic energy, and we can use that to heat up a working fluid and generate electricity.","51":"Well, that's a common recommendation, but the ideal amount of sleep can vary quite a bit from person to person. The most important thing is that you're getting the amount that makes you feel rested and energized throughout the day. Some people may need as little as 6 hours, while others do better with 8 or even 9 hours of sleep.","52":"Ah, wonderful! It's great to meet a fellow origami enthusiast who is also well-versed in the mathematics behind the art form. As a mathematician myself, I'd be very interested to hear more about your work and research in the mathematical aspects of origami. What are some of the key insights you've gained through your studies?","53":"Exactly! The origami technique allows us to create structures that can be compactly folded and then deployed into larger, more complex shapes. In the case of the Rover wheel, the origami design enables it to start in a small, compressed configuration and then unfold into a sturdy, full-sized wheel that can support the weight of the vehicle and navigate rough terrain.","54":"Well, one thing that's really exciting is the potential for origami-inspired deployable structures. These could be used in all sorts of applications, from space exploration to disaster relief. Imagine being able to pack a large structure into a small volume, then have it unfold and deploy automatically when needed. The design possibilities are really fascinating.","55":"It's a fundamental research area that requires a lot of time, effort, and investment to truly understand and advance. Blockchain is not just a trendy technology, but a complex system with deep implications that we're still working to unravel.","56":"The current financial system has many flaws and inefficiencies. Blockchain technology has the potential to address some of these issues by providing a more transparent, secure, and decentralized way of managing transactions and data.","57":"But the reality is, even though autonomous vehicles are not yet perfect, they are still much safer than human-driven cars. The same applies to blockchain - it may not be perfect, but it's a significant improvement over the traditional financial system in many ways.","58":"Ah, that's interesting! Biology and computer science are very different fields, but they can actually complement each other quite well. Biology is all about understanding the natural world, while computer science is about creating artificial systems. Have you ever thought about how computers and technology can be used to study and model biological systems? There are some fascinating intersections between the two disciplines.","59":"Okay, let's start with the basics then. Dimensions are the measurements or qualities that define the physical world around us. The first three dimensions are the ones we're most familiar with - length, width, and height. These describe the spatial properties of objects in our three-dimensional universe. Beyond that, there's also the fourth dimension, which is time. So those are the fundamental dimensions that shape our experience of the physical reality.","60":"Okay, so now you have two dimensions. How about we add a third dimension? Can you hold those three dimensions at right angles to each other?","61":"That's not possible. You can only physically hold two dimensions at right angles to each other at the same time. The third dimension is always going to be perpendicular to the other two. Visualizing and manipulating higher dimensions is a challenging concept, but it's an important part of understanding the complexity of our universe.","62":"Okay, got it? So that fourth dimension would be perpendicular to the other three, creating a four-dimensional space. This is how we can conceptualize and understand higher dimensions beyond the three that we can directly experience. Let me know if this makes sense or if you have any other questions!","63":"Well, there are actually other ways to represent the dimensions of objects and space. One common alternative is the polar coordinate system, which uses angles and distances instead of the Cartesian x, y, and z coordinates. This can be particularly useful for describing circular or spherical shapes. There's also the cylindrical coordinate system, which combines aspects of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.","64":"That's right, so we can describe a point in 2D space by two coordinates - the distance from the origin and the angle with respect to a reference axis. This gives us a way to fully specify the location of a point on a plane.","65":"Exactly! Time is often considered the fourth dimension, in addition to the three spatial dimensions we typically think of. The idea of extra spatial dimensions beyond the three we can directly observe is a fascinating concept in theoretical physics. Many theories, such as String Theory, postulate the existence of additional spatial dimensions that are not directly observable to us.","66":"So in that sense, dimensions can be thought of as different layers or perspectives that we use to understand the world around us. Each dimension provides a unique way of looking at and interacting with reality.","67":"Yes, it's quite a predicament! We've made incredible progress in understanding the universe, but there are still so many fundamental questions we can't seem to answer conclusively. It's both exciting and frustrating at the same time.","68":"Black holes were a fascinating topic back then, and I remember being really excited to learn about the latest developments in the field. It was a time of rapid progress and new discoveries.","69":"Yeah, it's really not as straightforward as it may seem at first. The more you dive into the complexities of black holes, the more you realize how much we still have to learn. There are so many intriguing aspects and unresolved questions that it can be both exciting and humbling as a researcher.","70":"You're absolutely right. The connectome, which is the comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, is crucial for understanding brain function. It's not just about the anatomy, but also the dynamic patterns of information flow and interactions between different brain regions. The connectome can reveal important insights about how the brain processes information and coordinates various cognitive and behavioral functions.","71":"The connectome, the intricate web of connections between neurons in the brain, is more than just a static map. It's a dynamic, ever-changing landscape that gives rise to the richness of our inner lives. The way those connections are forged, strengthened, and reshaped over time is what truly makes you, well, you.","72":"Exactly. You raise a really interesting point. The traditional approaches to chess AI have focused on brute-force calculation and evaluation of positions, which is very different from how humans play. Humans rely a lot on intuition, pattern recognition, and the ability to creatively explore the search space. That's something that's really hard to capture in current chess AI systems.","73":"Ah, I see. Moving the king is often a crucial defensive move in complex positions. It can help you avoid getting checkmated and buy you some time to find a counterattack. Let me walk you through a few of the key variations you were considering - that should help solidify the thought process.","74":"I can understand why that would be unsettling. Music harmony can sometimes evoke strong emotional responses, even if we don't fully understand the underlying theory behind it.","75":"Exactly, it creates a pull, a sense of resolution and completion. The shared root note between the chords establishes a tonal center, a gravitational pull that the listener's ear is drawn towards. This creates a feeling of coherence and stability, even if the surrounding harmonies have more tension or dissonance.","76":"The key of Amazing Grace is G major, and the basic chord progression is I-IV-V-I. This progression is common in a lot of hymns and folk songs, as it creates a sense of stability and resolution.","77":"That's right, hacking is the unauthorized access and manipulation of computer systems, which can lead to serious privacy breaches, data theft, and financial losses. It's a serious crime that can have significant consequences for both the hacker and the victim. I'm glad you understand why hacking is considered a bad thing.","78":"Yes, that's right. They use things like firewalls, encryption, and access controls to create layers of security that make it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access to the system. The goal is to create a strong defense that can withstand attempts by hackers to break in.","79":"The good hackers, or the cybersecurity experts, would typically report the vulnerability to the company that made the lock, or the software developers. Their goal is to help improve the security by identifying weaknesses, not to actually break into the lock or system themselves. They work with the companies to fix the issues and make the locks or software more secure for everyone.","80":"You make a good point. Breaking into a system, even with good intentions, can be risky and lead to legal consequences. That's why I caution against unauthorized access, as it's important to respect the law and the security measures in place. Instead, I'd suggest exploring ethical hacking or cybersecurity as a career path, where you can use your skills to help protect systems and organizations legally and responsibly.","81":"I started learning about computer programming and how to use that knowledge in a responsible way to help people and solve problems. It's important to use those skills ethically and not to cause harm.","82":"I know, you're right. But I was just curious and wanted to learn more about how things work. I didn't mean to do anything harmful or against the rules. I was just exploring and experimenting, but I realize now that I should have been more careful and respectful of the creator's intentions.","83":"That's great! If you think your idea could be useful for others, you should consider sharing it in a responsible way. There may be legal or ethical ways to implement it that don't involve hacking or breaking the rules. I'd be happy to discuss how you could explore your idea further without causing any harm.","84":"Hi there! It's great to see you as well. As an expert in the field of lasers, I'm always excited to discuss the latest advancements and applications of this technology. What would you like to know more about?","85":"That's true, we were able to accomplish a lot during my time there. But ultimately, my passion lies elsewhere, and I felt it was the right decision to move on and pursue other opportunities.","86":"Well, the challenge with using lasers for propulsion is the power density required. Current laser technology just isn't there yet in terms of being able to deliver the kind of concentrated energy needed to effectively accelerate a spacecraft. But the field is rapidly evolving, and who knows what breakthroughs might be just around the corner. It's an exciting area of research, for sure.","87":"That's a great point. Developing new algorithms or improving existing ones often involves identifying common patterns and optimizing for specific objectives. What are some of the key factors you consider when designing or evaluating algorithms?","88":"Precisely! The holographic principle suggests that the information contained within a given volume of space can be fully described by the information on its boundary. This has profound implications for our understanding of gravity and the nature of spacetime. The connection between quantum information and the geometry of spacetime is a central focus of modern theoretical physics.","89":"Precisely. The amount of information that can be stored in the gravity field of the observable universe is truly astronomical, pun intended. The scale and complexity of the gravitational interactions in the cosmos vastly exceed our current understanding and capabilities. Even as our knowledge grows, the universe continually surprises us with new discoveries that push the boundaries of what we thought possible.","90":"Well, I wouldn't recommend trying to hack into computer systems. That would be illegal and could get you into a lot of trouble. However, I'd be happy to discuss computer science and cybersecurity in a responsible way if you're interested. There's a lot of fascinating technology and concepts to explore that don't involve breaking the law.","91":"So when you're rewiring the inputs and outputs of that game, are you effectively hacking into the game's code and modifying it?","92":"Yes, good example! The space bar is an input that the computer accepts. Other common inputs could be the keyboard, mouse, touch screen, or even voice commands. The key is understanding how the system is designed to receive and process those inputs.","93":"Yes, exactly! The camera is another input device that can send visual information to the computer. Anything that can capture and transmit data to the computer can be considered an input device, like keyboards, mice, cameras, microphones, and more.","94":"Well, there are a variety of inputs that can be used in hacking, but I don't feel comfortable going into the specifics of that. Hacking generally involves exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems, which can be unethical and even illegal in many cases. I'd suggest focusing your interests and skills on more positive goals that don't involve harming others or breaking the law.","95":"The time it takes to get in can vary greatly depending on the specific system and the methods used. Some hacking attempts may be over in seconds, while others can take days or even weeks of persistent effort. The key is to have patience, persistence, and a deep understanding of the target system's vulnerabilities. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as each hacking situation is unique.","96":"That's a great combination! Physics and computer science complement each other really well. What interests you the most about those fields?","97":"Exactly! The chicken, of course. The order of the egg comes from the chicken, which itself is a highly complex and ordered system. The chicken is the source of the order we see in the egg, despite the general tendency towards disorder in the universe. This is a key example of how order can arise from the interactions of complex systems, even as the fundamental laws of physics don't distinguish between forward and backward time.","98":"In the movie Interstellar, they show this effect of gravitational time dilation very clearly. The characters on the planet with the stronger gravitational field experience time passing much slower than the characters on the spacecraft orbiting that planet. This is a direct consequence of Einstein's theories of relativity, which have been experimentally verified time and time again.","99":"Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature and the interactions between matter and energy. It helps us understand how the world around us works, from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the universe.","100":"Okay, that's a good way to think about it. You're right, you would be at a specific point on that line, facing it. Can you tell me more about how you would describe your location on that line?","101":"That's right. A dimension has its own unit, like length, width, or height. It's represented by a single number.","102":"Okay, let's start. So, dimensions are the different ways we can measure and describe the world around us. For example, we have length, width, and height - those are the three main dimensions that we use to describe the size and shape of objects.","103":"Dimensions are measurements that we use to describe the world around us. We have length, width, and height - those are the three main dimensions that we use to understand the size and shape of objects.","104":"That's right! If scientists found evidence of extra dimensions beyond the three that we experience, it would completely change our understanding of the universe. It would be a huge scientific breakthrough. What do you think some of the implications might be if such a discovery was made?","105":"And how did you find that course? I imagine it must have been quite challenging, given the complexity of quantum mechanics.","106":"Excellent, that's a great starting point. Quantum dots are really fascinating nanostructures that exhibit unique optical and electronic properties due to the quantum confinement effects at the nanoscale. They're essentially nanometer-scale semiconductor crystals that can be tuned to absorb and emit specific wavelengths of light by controlling their size. This makes them incredibly useful in a variety of applications, from displays and lighting to biological imaging and solar cells.","107":"Yes, that's correct! Carbon nanotubes are a type of nanomaterial made up of carbon atoms arranged in a cylindrical structure. They have unique properties like high strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal stability, making them useful for various applications in technology.","108":"Ah, good observation! Yes, those lights are actually related to the quantum dots I work with. The quantum dots I study have the ability to emit light when excited, and we've been exploring ways to harness that property for various applications, including innovative lighting solutions like the ones you see behind me. The tunability and efficiency of quantum dot-based lighting is really quite remarkable.","109":"You're right, nanotechnology does have a very futuristic and sci-fi feel to it. But the reality is that it's already becoming a reality in many industries. Nanotech involves the manipulation of materials on the atomic and molecular scale, which allows for the creation of incredibly small and precise devices and structures.","110":"This is a model of a computer chip. The tiny components you see on it are made using nanotechnology, which deals with materials and structures on the nanoscale - that's one-billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology allows us to create incredibly small and precise electronic components that make our modern digital devices possible.","111":"Exactly right! To increase the number of transistors on a chip, you need to make the individual transistors smaller. That's where nanotechnology comes in - it allows us to fabricate transistors and other electronic components at the nanoscale, which is a billionth of a meter. By making the transistors smaller, we can pack more of them onto a single chip, dramatically increasing the computing power and capabilities of our electronic devices.","112":"You raise a good point. Time is so deeply woven into how we conceptualize and describe change, it's hard to disentangle the two. Perhaps we could explore alternative ways of framing change without relying so heavily on temporal language. What other perspectives might we consider?","113":"Exactly! The speed of light being constant is the key to understanding Einstein's revolutionary idea that time is not absolute, but rather relative. This means that the passage of time can be different for different observers, depending on their relative motion and the effects of gravity. This was a profound shift in our understanding of the nature of time and the universe.","114":"Well, that was a major cybersecurity incident where hackers were able to gain access to Target's customer data, including credit card information. It highlighted the importance of strong cybersecurity measures for large companies that handle sensitive customer data.","115":"Ah, I see. Buffer overflows are a type of software vulnerability where you can input more data into a program than it's expecting, which can cause the program to behave in unintended ways. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, potentially giving them control over the machine. It's a common attack vector that hackers try to exploit, so understanding how they work is an important part of security and defensive programming.","116":"The study of that event led to major breakthroughs in our understanding of gravity and the nature of the universe. By carefully observing the gravitational effects experienced during that astronomical event, scientists were able to validate and refine Einstein's theory of general relativity.","117":"That's great, Amelia! I'm so glad to hear you're interested in science. Tell me, what is it about science that you find most fascinating?","118":"Okay, let me explain what an atom is. An atom is the basic unit of matter that makes up all the substances around us. It's the smallest piece of an element that still has the properties of that element. Atoms are made up of even smaller particles, like protons, neutrons, and electrons. When atoms of different elements come together, they can form new substances, like water or salt. Does this help explain what an atom is?","119":"Fusion is the process of combining two lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This happens when high temperatures and pressures are applied, typically in the core of stars like our Sun. The immense gravity and temperature conditions inside stars are able to overcome the repulsive force between the positively charged nuclei, allowing them to fuse together.","120":"These games use magnets to make the pieces move and stick to the board. Magnets are a really fascinating part of physics that we're still trying to understand better. What do you think about magnets and how they work?","121":"That's a great question. Fusion reactors use powerful magnetic fields to contain and control the hot, ionized plasma that's needed for fusion to occur. These magnetic fields essentially 'trap' the plasma, keeping it in a specific location so that the reaction can be sustained and studied. The challenge is maintaining the right balance of temperature, pressure, and containment to keep the plasma in the ideal state for fusion to take place.","122":"Exactly! Sleep is like recharging your body's batteries. When you sleep, your body and brain get a chance to rest and recover, so you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.","123":"Have you ever heard about sleep scientists before?","124":"And what do you think caused you to feel really tired?","125":"You're right, it's an amazing feat. Hippos have evolved to be able to sleep while partially submerged in water. Their bodies have adapted to allow them to regulate their breathing and stay oxygenated even while sleeping. It's a fascinating example of how different species have developed unique solutions to the universal need for sleep.","126":"That's right, the dolphin! Dolphins are fascinating creatures, and they are actually very closely related to sleep scientists.","127":"Dolphins don't sleep the way we do. They have to be conscious to breathe, so they have a unique way of sleeping. One half of their brain sleeps at a time, while the other half remains awake and conscious to control their breathing and keep them afloat. This is called unihemispheric sleep, and it allows dolphins to rest without completely losing consciousness.","128":"Okay, that's fine. Let's go over the basics of lasers then. What do you know about how they work and their key properties?","129":"Ah, I see. In that case, we could explore the use of femtosecond lasers for selective cell ablation. These ultrafast laser pulses can be precisely targeted to damage or destroy a single cell without affecting the surrounding tissue. The key is to carefully control the laser parameters, such as the pulse energy and duration, to induce localized photodisruption or photochemical reactions within the target cell.","130":"You're absolutely right. The key is not just solving the technical challenges, but also understanding how this technology can be integrated into our lives in a meaningful and beneficial way. We need to carefully consider the social and ethical implications of virtual reality, and work to ensure that it enhances and enriches human experiences, rather than replacing or diminishing them. Only then can we truly unlock the full creative potential of this technology.","131":"So, the inverse-square law means that as the distance between two objects increases, the gravitational force between them decreases exponentially. For example, if you double the distance, the force is reduced by a factor of four. This is why gravity seems so much stronger when you're close to a massive object, like a planet, compared to when you're far away from it.","132":"Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts objects with mass towards each other. It's the force that keeps the planets orbiting the Sun, and it's also what causes objects to fall to the ground when you drop them.","133":"That's right, the object would fall downwards due to the Earth's gravity. Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards the center of the Earth. This is what causes objects to accelerate downwards when dropped or released near the Earth's surface.","134":"What were you thinking about just then? You looked like you had an 'aha' moment.","135":"Gravity is such a fundamental force in the universe, and it's incredible how it shapes the motion of celestial bodies and even our everyday lives on Earth.","136":"Algorithms are much more than just a way to store information in computers. They are step-by-step procedures that computers use to solve problems and perform tasks. Algorithms can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple calculations to complex data analysis and decision-making. They are the foundation of how computers work and are essential for modern technology.","137":"Exactly! That's the problem with randomly organized lists. If an item is at the bottom, it can take a long time to find it, especially if the list is really long. This is where algorithms come in. They provide efficient ways to organize and search through data, so you can quickly find what you're looking for.","138":"If the person is on one of the middle pages, the algorithm would still be able to find them. The algorithm doesn't care where the person is located in the book, as long as it has the information to locate them.","139":"That's a good idea! I could start with the binary search approach to quickly narrow down the section, and then switch to a linear search within that smaller range. That way, I get the best of both worlds - the efficiency of the binary search initially, and the robustness of the linear search when I'm closer to the target. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll give that a try!","140":"That's a great analogy! Algorithms are a lot like driving on a highway. You can use different strategies to get to your destination efficiently, just like you described. The key is finding the right balance between speed and precision, depending on the task at hand. Can you think of any other examples that illustrate how algorithms work in real-life situations?","141":"Okay, great. So, if John is in the K section, and he's to the left, that means he's somewhere before the K's in the alphabetical order. Now, let's think about how we might find John's location using an algorithm.","142":"Exactly! That's the idea of a binary search algorithm. I can keep dividing the remaining pages in half, checking if the page I'm on is before or after the page I'm looking for, and then discarding the half that I know doesn't contain the page. This way, I can quickly narrow down the search space and find the page I'm looking for, even in a very large book.","143":"So, the key idea here is that by repeatedly splitting the problem in half, we can drastically reduce the search space and find the target much more efficiently. This is the essence of a binary search algorithm, which is a fundamental technique in computer science.","144":"Exactly! If I start with 1,000 pages and divide them in half repeatedly, I would do that 10 times to get down to a single page. So the third algorithm would take around 10 steps to find John, if he's on one of those 1,000 pages. The key is that by repeatedly halving the search space, the number of steps grows logarithmically with the size of the initial data set.","145":"So, to summarize, the first algorithm is slow, the second is faster, and the third algorithm is fundamentally faster because it divides and conquers the problem in half, rather than just taking one or two bites at a time. This is the kind of algorithm that powers how your phone searches for contacts or information, making the process much more efficient.","146":"Oh, the three, two program for biomedical engineering? That's an interesting track. What got you interested in that field?","147":"Yes, the basic premise is the same. The key difference is that with chirped pulse amplification, we can safely amplify the light before compressing it back into a short, high-energy pulse. This allows us to avoid damaging the laser components or the target material. The end result is still a 'laser hammer' that can be used for various applications, but the way we generate that high-power pulse is more controlled and efficient.","148":"Exactly, those are great examples of the types of features a machine learning model might consider when classifying an email as spam or not. The model could look at the sender's email address, the presence of certain keywords, whether the recipient has interacted with the sender before, and other contextual information to make that determination. The model essentially learns patterns from historical data to make predictions on new, unseen emails.","149":"One way to improve machine learning algorithms is to focus on creating more interpretable and explainable models. While highly accurate black-box models can be valuable, they often lack transparency and make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. By building interpretable systems on top of accurate machine learning models, we can gain insights into the underlying factors driving the predictions, which can lead to better decision-making and trust in the system.","150":"Impressive! You're right, I'm holding up three fingers. This demonstrates how virtual reality can create immersive experiences that make it feel like you're really there, even without moving your eyes to focus on the object. The ability to perceive depth and details without direct visual focus is a key feature of VR technology.","151":"That's really fascinating. So you're essentially hijacking the virus's natural replication process to get it to build materials for you. How does that work in practice? Do you just inject the modified virus into a bacterial culture and it starts churning out the desired nanostructures?","152":"Can you elaborate on that vision for environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis? What specific advancements or technologies do you see emerging in the next 5-10 years?","153":"Gravity. Gravity is the force that keeps us on the Earth and prevents us from floating off into space.","154":"Blackholes have an incredibly strong gravitational pull that is so strong, it doesn't even let light escape. That means if you get too close to a blackhole, nothing, not even light, can get out of its grasp. The gravity is so intense that it would completely crush anything that falls into it.","155":"That's right! Today we're going to learn about something called the connectome. The connectome is a map of all the connections in the brain.","156":"And did you know that inside each of those cells, there are these tiny structures called neurons? Neurons are like the building blocks of your brain and nervous system. They're like little messengers that send signals and information throughout your body.","157":"So, when we talk about time, we're really talking about the causal structure of the universe. The flow of time, the progression of events, is a fundamental aspect of how the universe operates.","158":"Ah, I see. So you would say Galileo laid the groundwork, but it was really Newton who solidified and formalized the modern understanding of time. That makes a lot of sense. Galileo's pioneering work on motion and his insights into the nature of time set the stage for Newton's groundbreaking theories and laws.","159":"That's a great paper. Side channel analysis is a really fascinating area of research. Have you thought about exploring it further? There are a lot of interesting applications, like detecting malware or even monitoring the health of hardware components.","160":"Wireless hacking does introduce some additional complexities and risks that wired hacking doesn't have. Things like managing wireless signal coverage, avoiding detection, and securing your own wireless connection become important factors to consider. But the core principles and techniques of hacking remain similar regardless of the medium you're working with.","161":"I think it's a huge overreach and an attack on consumer rights. We should have the ability to inspect and modify the products we own, whether it's a car, a smartphone, or any other device. Restricting that access is just another way for companies to maintain control and lock users into their ecosystem.","162":"Well, you know, I can't really encourage anything illegal, even if it's just exploring or inspecting something. As a professor, I have to be careful about the advice I give. But I understand the curiosity and the desire to understand how things work. Maybe we could explore some legal options or discuss the underlying ethical considerations instead?","163":"That's really fascinating. Fault attacks are such an interesting area of security research. What kind of devices have you been looking at, and what have you found in terms of their susceptibility to these attacks? I'm always curious to learn more about the practical implications and how much risk organizations should be concerned about when it comes to these types of vulnerabilities.","164":"That's a really interesting example. Fault injection can be a powerful technique for getting around security measures in all kinds of devices, not just cryptocurrency wallets. The idea of being able to bypass the authentication process by manipulating the device's environment rather than directly attacking the cryptographic algorithms is really clever. Do you have any other examples of how you've used fault injection techniques to bypass security in embedded systems or other types of hardware?","165":"That's interesting. It sounds like there's a lot of potential for new research and innovations in security, especially around fault injection and side channel attacks. It seems like as hardware security claims get more sophisticated, researchers will need to develop more advanced techniques to continue finding vulnerabilities. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on what some of the key focus areas or trends might be in the next few years as this space evolves.","166":"Amazing Grace is a beautiful hymn that has been recorded by many artists over the years. The melody is very simple and the lyrics talk about the grace of God. It's a song that has brought comfort and inspiration to people all around the world. Would you like me to play a recording of it for you so you can hear what it sounds like?","167":"Could you tell me more about why it sounds better to you? What do you notice about the harmony or the way the different parts fit together?","168":"What do black holes have to do with the concept of time?","169":"That would be an incredible power, to be able to go back and alter the course of history. Just imagine the possibilities, the ability to right wrongs, prevent tragedies, or even shape the future in ways we can't even foresee. Of course, the responsibility that comes with such power would be immense, and the potential for unintended consequences is daunting. But the allure of changing the past is undeniable.","170":"That's where the concept of time travel and its potential paradoxes really get fascinating. The idea of a billiard ball going into a wormhole and interacting with its past self raises all sorts of philosophical and logical questions about the nature of causality and the flow of time. It challenges our intuitive notions of how time should work and forces us to grapple with some mind-bending implications.","171":"Ah, that's an interesting perspective. So in that donut-shaped universe, would time be circular or looped, rather than a linear progression?","172":"I'm quite familiar with the concepts of time dilation and length contraction from the special theory of relativity. As a graduate student, I've studied these ideas in depth and can apply them to my own research.","173":"That's an interesting perspective. Time can certainly feel vast and overwhelming from a human scale. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, our individual lives are just a fleeting moment. The true nature of eternity is something that may be difficult for us to fully grasp or experience.","174":"So the goal in chess is to capture the opponent's king, while protecting your own king from being captured.","175":"Excellent! That's a great example of a quick checkmate tactic. You were able to see multiple moves ahead and find a way to deliver checkmate in just three moves. That's the kind of tactical vision and planning that makes chess so engaging and rewarding to play. Now, let's try another position and see if you can find a longer-term strategic plan.","176":"Okay, let's go through the first three moves that white gets. What do you think the first move for white should be?","177":"That's a great observation! You're absolutely right, I'm likely trying to trade some pieces and then go after your king. That's a really important part of chess strategy - looking at the position, understanding your opponent's weaknesses, and then formulating a plan to exploit them. Keep thinking about the big picture like that, and you'll start to see the game unfold in a whole new way.","178":"Exactly! In a closed position, the pieces are more cramped and have fewer open lines. But in an open position, the pieces have more space to maneuver and control more of the board. That's a really insightful observation. Being able to recognize when a position is closed or open is an important skill in chess.","179":"Ah, I see what you mean. The position of the black king does seem quite vulnerable compared to the white king. That's a very insightful observation. Can you tell me more about why you think the black king is in a precarious position on the board?","180":"Exactly! That's right. Bishop takes pawn on e4 is a great tactic here, because it attacks my weakened king. Well done, you're really starting to understand the key principles of chess strategy.","181":"Excellent move! Taking the rook is a strong counterattack. Now, I would have to carefully consider my next step to defend against your threat.","182":"That's really fascinating. So you're essentially using nanomaterials as a way to enhance the performance, safety, and overall functionality of batteries. What kind of specific properties or capabilities are you able to achieve by incorporating these nanomaterials? I'd be really interested to hear more about the specific improvements you're able to realize.","183":"Absolutely, the improvements in display technology, processing power, and tracking systems are going to make virtual reality experiences even more realistic and seamless. As the hardware and software continue to evolve, we'll see VR becoming more responsive, visually stunning, and truly immersive. The sense of presence and interactivity in these virtual environments will only become more convincing over time.","184":"Absolutely. Virtual reality opens up a whole new world of possibilities for creative expression and immersive experiences. The ability to bring our imaginations to life in a virtual space is truly remarkable. With VR, the boundaries of what's possible are constantly being pushed, allowing us to create entirely new worlds and narratives that were once confined to our minds.","185":"That's right, trading is when you exchange something you have for something someone else has. With blockchain, people can trade things like money, property, or even digital items without going through a central authority like a bank or government.","186":"That's a good idea! Trading something you don't like for something you do like can be a great way to get what you want. The blockchain technology can help make that kind of trading and exchange easier and more secure.","187":"You're on the right track! Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence where computers and machines are able to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The idea is to develop algorithms and statistical models that allow systems to perform specific tasks effectively without using rule-based programming.","188":"Great, so if you were to use a music streaming service, that service might use machine learning to analyze your listening history and recommend other artists that are similar to Melanie Martinez. The algorithm would look for patterns in the data of your listening habits and try to find other artists that you might also enjoy based on your preferences.","189":"Ah I see, so Spotify's recommendation algorithm likely picked up on the distinctive vocal effect you mentioned and used that to suggest a similar sounding song. Machine learning models can be trained to identify and learn from audio features like that to make personalized song recommendations. The more data they have on your music preferences, the better they can get at predicting what you might enjoy next.","190":"Exactly! Companies often use machine learning to analyze user data and personalize content or advertisements. By training algorithms on large datasets, they can identify patterns and make predictions that help them serve more relevant and engaging experiences to their users. Machine learning is a powerful tool for understanding complex data, automating decision-making, and optimizing business processes.","191":"Not exactly. A laser is different from a light bulb in a few key ways. A light bulb emits light in all directions, while a laser produces a very focused, concentrated beam of light. The light from a laser is also much more coherent and monochromatic compared to the light from a bulb.","192":"the right amount of power or intensity to be able to actually cut through the material. The laser beam needs to be focused and have enough energy density to melt or vaporize the material it's interacting with.","193":"Exactly, that's a great analogy. The lens in the laser system works just like a magnifying glass, focusing the light down to a very small, intense spot. Just like how a magnifying glass can concentrate sunlight and set something on fire, the laser's lens concentrates the laser light to create a powerful, focused beam that can cut through materials.","194":"So when we talk about the length of a laser beam, we're really talking about the duration or pulse length of the laser. The shorter the pulse, the more concentrated the energy in that pulse. This allows lasers to achieve extremely high intensities, which is important for many applications like laser cutting or laser welding.","195":"Exactly! That's the power of lasers. We can take all that energy and focus it down into these incredibly concentrated beams that are practically invisible to the naked eye. These laser beams can pack a huge punch, even though they're so thin and seemingly harmless. That's why lasers are used for all sorts of applications, from precision cutting and welding to medical procedures and even military technology.","196":"a very small spot, where the energy density is very high. And that's what allows us to use lasers for precision machining, like cutting or welding materials.","197":"Okay, let's start by folding the paper in half. Then, we'll need to make a few more folds to create the origami shape. I'll walk you through the steps, and you can follow along with your paper.","198":"Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It involves creating beautiful and intricate designs by folding a single sheet of paper, without using any glue or cuts.","199":"Alright, let's get started. I'll show you the step-by-step process of how to fold the traditional origami crane. Pay close attention, and if you get stuck, feel free to ask me for help.","200":"Did you see how I did that? Now, let's try it together. Take the paper and fold it in half, then hold it between your thumb and forefinger. Reach inside and grab the skinny point, then slide it out to the side. Spread the wings, and you've got your very own origami crane!","201":"To make a cootie catcher, you'll need a square piece of paper. Watch me carefully as I demonstrate the steps, and then you can try it yourself.","202":"Yes, origami is the art of folding paper into various shapes and figures. It's fascinating how a simple sheet of paper can be transformed into complex and intricate designs just by carefully creasing and folding it.","203":"That's not the only thing we can do with this origami model. Let me show you another cool way to transform it.","204":"Ah, yes, the bubble sort algorithm! That's a great example of a simple sorting algorithm. Let me walk through the steps of how it works. The basic idea is to compare adjacent elements in the list and swap them if they're in the wrong order. You then repeat this process, 'bubbling' the larger elements up to the top of the list, until the entire list is sorted.","205":"Okay, let's try that. What's the next step?","206":"So now we can just focus on the remaining elements and finish the sorting process.","207":"Not quite. Gravity is actually what allows us to launch things into space. The trick is to achieve enough velocity to overcome the Earth's gravitational pull. When a rocket is launched, the engines provide the force needed to accelerate it to a speed where the Earth's gravity can no longer hold it down, and it can escape the planet's atmosphere and enter orbit.","208":"The gravity is still pulling on the International Space Station, but because it's moving so fast, it's constantly 'falling' around the Earth. This is called 'free fall'. The station is in a stable orbit, so it's continuously falling towards the Earth but never actually hits the ground. It's essentially just floating in space, but the gravity of the Earth is keeping it in its orbit.","209":"Exactly! It's the same principle. The riders feel like they're being pressed against the walls, but they're not actually spinning - the ride is spinning around them. It's the centrifugal force that keeps them pinned in place, just like how the Earth's gravity keeps the International Space Station in orbit.","210":"Exactly! That's because of gravity. When you're in a train, you're still being pulled down by gravity, so you don't feel the motion of the train. But when another train starts moving next to you, the sudden change in visual cues makes it seem like you're the one moving instead.","211":"Yes, that's the essence of Einstein's theory of special relativity. The idea that there is no absolute motion, and that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. It really changes our intuitive understanding of the world, but it's been experimentally validated time and time again.","212":"According to the theory of general relativity, gravity is not a force like the other fundamental forces in nature. Instead, it is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This means that massive objects, like the Earth, actually bend the fabric of spacetime around them, and this bending is what we experience as the force of gravity.","213":"Well, that's exactly what happens with the speed of light. Even though Marina is racing towards the light pulse, you both still measure the speed of the light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. That's because the speed of light is a constant, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source of the light. This is a fundamental principle of Einstein's theory of special relativity.","214":"And the key idea is that this tube, this extra dimension, can actually form dynamically, without the need for any external force or mechanism to compactify it. It just naturally arises as a consequence of the underlying physics and geometry.","215":"We don't actually assume that all the dimensions are large from the start. That's an important question to address. The large dimensions emerge as a result of the specific mathematical framework and physical principles we're working with. Let me walk you through how that happens step-by-step...","216":"Okay, I understand the concept of a P-brane, but what specifically is a black brane? How does it differ from a regular P-brane?","217":"Exactly, that's a really key point. The non-singular brane solutions that we find in de Sitter space can actually connect to an anti-de Sitter interior, which is hugely important for a lot of the AdS\/CFT applications and the connections between gravity and quantum field theory. It's a really rich and fascinating area of research.","218":"So with this picture, you have a three-dimensional universe, but then two of the spatial dimensions are compactified into a sphere. The remaining uncompactified dimension would correspond to our observable universe, while the two compactified dimensions would be curled up at a fixed radius, not accessible to us directly.","219":"Not necessarily the lowest action. What happens is that the transverse dimensions, the ones that are compactified, don't really affect the cosmological evolution of the dimensions that we observe. So you can have a wide range of possibilities for the compactified dimensions, and they'll just act as a spectator to the main cosmological evolution.","220":"Can you tell me more about the discussion in the literature? What are some of the key points of debate?","221":"In that graphic novel, I explore how the emergence of spacetime and the classical world we observe can arise from the underlying quantum mechanical description of reality. It's a visual and interactive way to explain these complex concepts.","222":"Okay, let me try to explain it again. The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections in the brain. It's considered a fundamental part of understanding how the brain works and how it's organized.","223":"Exactly. The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections in the brain. By studying the patterns and pathways of these connections, researchers can gain insights into how the brain is organized and how information is processed. The connectome provides a structural foundation for understanding brain function and how it relates to behavior, cognition, and even personality.","224":"That's really cool that the show inspired you to start playing chess more seriously. What do you enjoy most about the game?","225":"Okay, let's see... Ah, here's a game from last month. It looks like a pretty interesting one. Let's take a closer look and see what we can learn from it.","226":"Well, the typical way to develop your bishop is to move it to a central square, like c4 or f4. That way, it can control the center and threaten your opponent's position. But you want to wait until you've developed your other pieces first, so your bishop isn't isolated or vulnerable. What do you think about that approach?","227":"Exactly! If your opponent has a pawn that can advance and create a pawn break, that's often a critical moment in the game. You'll need to be prepared to respond to that potential pawn break, either by preventing it or by counterattacking. Staying alert to your opponent's pawn structure and potential pawn breaks is a key part of navigating the middle game successfully.","228":"Exactly! By moving this pawn, I've activated my bishop, which now has more options and can put pressure on your position. This is a common strategic idea in chess - using pawn breaks to activate your pieces and create threats.","229":"That's a good observation. In a closed position with more minor pieces, advancing the pawn can be advantageous for Black. However, you also have to consider the pawn structure and any potential weaknesses that could arise. Keeping the tension and controlling the center is often a safer strategy, especially against a more experienced player. The key is to weigh the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that best fits your overall position and plan.","230":"Excellent, that's right. The e-file is now open for your rook or queen to potentially dominate that column. What other positional advantages do you think that move created for you?","231":"Harmony is the backbone that supports the melody. It's the framework that allows the melody to move and breathe, to express its full range of emotions. Without harmony, a melody would be just a bare-bones line, lacking depth and richness. It's the harmony that gives the melody its color, its texture, its sense of direction and resolution.","232":"Music harmony is all about how different notes sound together, creating chords and progressions that give a piece of music its overall sound and feel. It's what makes a simple melody come alive and adds depth and richness to the musical experience.","233":"That's exactly right! Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. It's what keeps us grounded on Earth and prevents us from floating away into space. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that plays a crucial role in the behavior of objects, both on Earth and throughout the universe.","234":"Exactly! The Moon's gravity is what causes the ocean tides to rise and fall. As the Moon orbits the Earth, its gravitational pull tugs on the water in the oceans, creating the high and low tides that we observe.","235":"No, if gravity was too strong, we would not be able to get up. The force of gravity would be so great that it would be impossible for us to overcome it and move around. Our bodies are adapted to the specific strength of gravity on Earth, and if it were stronger, we simply wouldn't have the physical capability to stand or walk.","236":"\"What's wrong, Bonet?\"","237":"The reason for this is that in the absence of gravity, the discs between the vertebrae in the spine are able to expand and decompress, allowing the spine to elongate. Gravity is constantly compressing the spine when we're on Earth, but in the microgravity environment of space, the spine can stretch out to its full length without being compressed.","238":"Well, the story goes that Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree one day, and an apple fell on his head. That made him start thinking about why the apple fell straight down instead of floating away. And that led him to come up with the idea of gravity, the force that pulls objects towards each other.","239":"So, what Newton realized was that there is a force that pulls objects towards the Earth, and this force is what we call gravity. He was able to describe this force mathematically, which allowed him to explain why objects fall to the ground and also why the planets orbit the Sun.","240":"When a heavy object is dropped, it falls to the ground due to the force of gravity. Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. The Earth's gravity pulls objects down towards its surface.","241":"That's a great question. Fusion is a promising technology for the future, but it's still facing some significant challenges. While fusion could potentially provide a abundant, clean source of energy, there are technical hurdles that need to be overcome before it can realistically replace our current energy mix. The timeline for widespread fusion adoption is still quite uncertain.","242":"Plasma is a state of matter that's quite different from the familiar solid, liquid, and gas states. It's a hot, ionized gas that behaves in unique ways, making it challenging to understand and control. The physics of plasmas is a specialized field within plasma physics, which is crucial for understanding fusion and other high-energy phenomena.","243":"Exactly! The collective behavior of the plasma is where a lot of the really fascinating physics happens. When you have this extremely hot, dense plasma confined by these strong magnetic fields, you get all sorts of complex wave and instability phenomena emerging. These can have a big impact on how the fusion reactions actually occur and how efficiently we can extract the energy from the plasma.","244":"The computational challenges of simulating fusion processes in detail are immense. Even with the most powerful supercomputers available today, it would take an unfathomable amount of time to accurately model all the complex interactions and dynamics involved. The sheer scale and complexity of fusion systems is simply staggering from a computational perspective.","245":"Gyrokinetic refers to a simplified particle model used in plasma physics to study the behavior of charged particles in a magnetic field. In this model, the fast gyration of the particles around the magnetic field lines is averaged out, reducing the dimensionality of the problem and making it computationally more tractable.","246":"And that frequency, that gyro frequency, is a key parameter in fusion research. It tells us a lot about the behavior of the plasma and how it interacts with the magnetic fields that confine it.","247":"I see, that's understandable. How does your work on the cerebellum relate to the broader field of sleep science? I'm curious to learn more about the potential connections.","248":"What do you think are the key mechanisms or processes involved in the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness during sleep?","249":"Oh, you've never tried that? Laser pointers are really fun to play with cats. The cats can't ever catch the laser, but they love chasing it around. It's a great way to entertain them.","250":"That's right! The laser beam is much more focused and concentrated than the broad beam of a flashlight. The laser light is all traveling in the same direction, which is what makes it so intense and concentrated on a small spot. A flashlight has light going in all different directions, so it doesn't have that same focused beam.","251":"Light from a laser is a special kind of light. Unlike the light from a regular light bulb, laser light is highly focused and very, very concentrated. This allows lasers to have all sorts of amazing applications, from cutting through metal to sending information through fiber optic cables.","252":"That's right! The laser beam can actually bend around corners and illuminate things that are not directly in its path. This is because the beam of light is highly focused and directional, allowing it to travel around obstacles and illuminate areas that would normally be hidden from view.","253":"Lasers are very powerful beams of light that are much more concentrated and intense than the light from ordinary sources like the sun or light bulbs. They can be used for all sorts of things, from cutting materials to transmitting information over long distances.","254":"That's because you're seeing the laser beam. Lasers emit a very focused, concentrated beam of light that is usually invisible, but can become visible when it interacts with particles in the air or when it hits a surface.","255":"Tessellations are really fascinating, aren't they? The intricate patterns that emerge from a single sheet of paper are truly remarkable. What do you think draws people to this more abstract and geometric form of origami?","256":"No, the origami pieces are not cut. They are created by folding a single sheet of paper into intricate designs and shapes. The beauty of origami is that it transforms a flat piece of paper into a three-dimensional object without any cutting or gluing.","257":"Yes, that's a great start! You've created a fold that doesn't run all the way across the paper, which is an important technique in origami. Let's explore how we can build on that basic fold to create more complex shapes and structures.","258":"Exactly! All the folds in origami are reversible. You can take a mountain fold and flatten it into a valley, or vice versa. The ability to reverse the folds is what gives origami its flexibility and allows you to create such intricate designs.","259":"That's a really interesting pattern! Can you explain more about why that's the case? What is the mathematical or geometric principle behind that alternating mountain and valley structure in origami shapes?","260":"Yes, twists. This is a basic technique used in many origami tessellations. When you create a twist, you're taking a square and twisting it, which creates a rotational motion and a unique shape. Let me show you how to do it step-by-step.","261":"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to perform a specific task effectively without using rule-based programming.","262":"Ah, I see what you're saying. From the description, it does sound like the image is depicting a cat rather than a dog. Cats do tend to have a more slender and elongated body shape compared to dogs, with taller legs and more pointed ears. Your observation skills are quite impressive! Let's look at a few more images and see if you can identify the animals in those as well.","263":"That's the goal of machine learning models - to learn patterns from the training data and then apply that knowledge to new, unseen data. The model is trained on a set of examples, and then it can make predictions or decisions on new inputs that it hasn't seen before.","264":"I see. That's a good point about the trust and guarantees that eBay provides. But have you ever heard of blockchain technology? It's a new way of handling financial transactions that could potentially disrupt platforms like eBay by providing even more security and transparency.","265":"Blockchain technology is aimed at eliminating the need for these middlemen by creating a decentralized system where transactions can be verified and recorded directly between parties without the involvement of a central authority.","266":"Well, blockchain technology allows for a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a network. When a new transaction occurs, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that there is no single point of failure, and the records are immutable, making it a secure and transparent way to conduct transactions without the need for intermediaries.","267":"That's right! In virtual reality, you wear a special headset that immerses you in a fully digital environment. The headset tracks your head movements, so when you look around, the virtual world responds accordingly. It's like being transported into a different world!","268":"Exactly! Virtual reality can transport you to any virtual world, like the blocky, pixelated world of Minecraft. You can fully immerse yourself in that digital environment and interact with it just as you would in the real world.","269":"Blockchain is a type of digital ledger that records transactions in a secure, decentralized, and transparent way. It's a distributed database that allows multiple parties to store and share information without the need for a central authority.","270":"You're absolutely right. Blockchain technology is designed to eliminate the need for centralized intermediaries, such as banks, payment processors, and other financial institutions. The decentralized nature of blockchain allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions without the involvement of these middlemen. This can disrupt traditional business models and reduce the fees and delays associated with using centralized services.","271":"Origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. These intricate designs are created by carefully folding a single sheet of paper without cutting or gluing.","272":"No, not a paper airplane. I'm talking about origami, the Japanese art of folding paper into intricate shapes. To make one point out of a square sheet of paper, you would start by folding the sheet in half diagonally to create a triangle, and then folding that triangle in half to create a smaller triangle with a single point.","273":"You can see that the circular regions from each of the points on the crane are quite visible. This demonstrates the key insight that the paper is used most efficiently when the folds are made from the corners or edges, creating these circular regions that tessellate across the paper. This is a foundational principle in origami that helps guide the design of efficient and elegant folding patterns.","274":"So, this fifth circle that we've identified is actually a really important part of the origami crane. It's what gives the crane its distinctive shape and allows it to stand up on its own. This extra layer and point is what differentiates the origami crane from a simple paper folding. It's a key part of the design that makes the crane look so elegant and lifelike.","275":"To design origami, you'll need to understand the basic origami techniques and folds. These include the mountain fold, valley fold, reverse fold, and other essential maneuvers. Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you can start experimenting with different paper shapes and patterns to create your own unique origami designs.","276":"Okay, let's start with an algorithm for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The steps would be something like this: 1) Take two slices of bread, 2) Spread peanut butter on one slice, 3) Spread jelly on the other slice, 4) Put the two slices together. Does that make sense?","277":"That's right! The memory or RAM in a computer is where the instructions and data are stored. The CPU can then access and process that information from the memory. So the CPU is like the brain, and the memory is like the storage or knowledge that the brain can use to carry out different tasks and computations.","278":"Okay, great! Let's start by thinking about the steps we need to take to make something. What's the first thing we should do?","279":"Great, that's a good next step. Cleaning up the mess is an important part of the process. What would be the steps to clean up the mess?","280":"Right, you need to be more specific with your search query. Google has an algorithm that tries to understand what you're looking for and returns the most relevant results. The algorithm looks at things like the words you use, your location, your search history, and other factors to provide the best possible answer.","281":"So, tell me, what have you been working on lately in the field of sleep science?","282":"That's a really significant finding. Sleep apnea is a common condition that often goes undiagnosed, so that could have major implications for Alzheimer's prevention. What other sleep-related factors have you looked at in relation to Alzheimer's risk?","283":"That's really interesting. So it sounds like the sleep disruptions are associated with both the buildup of beta-amyloid as well as the tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease models. Can you talk a bit more about what the specific sleep changes are that have been observed in these animal models? I'm curious to understand the nature of the sleep disturbances and how they might relate to the underlying neurodegeneration.","284":"That's really fascinating. Being able to use first-principle simulations to optimize reactor design and performance must be a huge step forward. Can you tell me more about how these simulations are helping guide the development of future fusion reactors? What kind of insights are they providing that weren't possible before?","285":"The circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationship between different keys and the chords that are commonly used in those keys. It shows how the keys are related to each other, with each key being a perfect fifth apart from the next. This helps musicians understand how chords and keys function within the tonal system, and it provides a framework for thinking about harmonic progressions and modulations.","286":"And then we have the tonic, the I chord, which is C major.","287":"Exactly, that's a great way to think about it in chess as well. The player with the initiative has the ability to dictate the flow of the game and put their opponent on the defensive. They have more options and more control over the position. Maintaining the initiative is often a key strategic goal in chess.","288":"Ah, I see what you mean. You're right, I do have the initiative here. That's an interesting observation about how I phrased my previous statement. It's important in chess to recognize when you have the initiative and to try to maintain it. Let's explore this position further and see how we can best utilize the initiative.","289":"You know, I was looking at that position and I think black has a lot of interesting ideas here. Black seems to have a lot of active pieces putting pressure on white's position, and it's going to be tough for white to find a way to counterattack.","290":"Alright, let's see what you've got. Make your move and let's see how this game plays out.","291":"A connectome is a map of the neural connections in the brain. It's like a wiring diagram that shows how all the different parts of the brain are connected to each other. Researchers are trying to create a complete map of the human connectome to better understand how the brain works and how it develops over time.","292":"That's right. When a massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses under its own gravity, forming an incredibly dense object known as a black hole. The intense gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This is what makes black holes appear 'black' - the gravity is so powerful that no light can be emitted from the region around the black hole.","293":"No, that's not an extra dimension. The concept of dimensions in physics is more specific than just adding or removing extra spaces or directions. Dimensions refer to the fundamental ways we can describe the state of a system, such as the three spatial dimensions and the one time dimension that make up our familiar four-dimensional spacetime.","294":"Well, the key thing to understand about dimensions is that they represent the degrees of freedom in a system. So in a 3D space, you have three dimensions - length, width, and depth - which give you three degrees of freedom to describe the position and orientation of an object. The higher the number of dimensions, the more ways an object can move and change within that space.","295":"Exactly! And one of the key predictions of string theory is that there are actually more than the three spatial dimensions and one time dimension that we experience in our everyday lives. String theory predicts the existence of additional dimensions, typically six or seven, that are compactified or curled up at a tiny scale that we can't directly observe.","296":"String theory proposes that our universe is not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time, but rather it exists in higher dimensions that are curled up and hidden from our view. By introducing these extra dimensions, string theory seeks to reconcile the apparent incompatibility between quantum mechanics and gravity.","297":"The concept of dimensions comes from the mathematical study of space and the way we describe the world around us. In our everyday experience, we typically think of three dimensions - length, width, and height. But in the realm of mathematics and physics, there can be more or even fewer dimensions depending on the context.","298":"And if you have a two-dimensional surface that is vibrating, you call it a membrane. So the next step up would be a three-dimensional vibrating object, which we call a volume or a solid.","299":"In string theory, the different particles and their properties emerge from the different ways the strings can vibrate and interact. The way the strings oscillate and the way they interact with each other determines the masses, charges, and other properties of the particles we observe in our universe. So the strings themselves don't have these properties, but the patterns and dynamics of the strings give rise to the particle zoo we see.","300":"So in string theory, we're not just talking about the four dimensions of space and time that we experience. Instead, we're working with ten or eleven dimensions - with the extra dimensions being curled up or compactified in a way that we can't directly observe them.","301":"So with zero-knowledge proofs, the key idea is that you can prove that you know something, without actually revealing what that something is. This allows you to demonstrate knowledge or a fact without disclosing the underlying information.","302":"That's where the zero-knowledge proof comes in. Zero-knowledge proofs allow you to demonstrate that you possess some information or knowledge without actually revealing that information. The prover can convince the verifier that they know a certain secret, without disclosing the secret itself.","303":"without revealing any intermediate steps or the final result to the other party. The prover can essentially convince the verifier that a certain statement is true, without disclosing any additional information beyond that.","304":"Excellent, that's a great background. As a physics student, I'm sure you have some understanding of what a black hole is. Could you share your impression of what a black hole is and what the key characteristics are?","305":"That's because the length of a fractal is infinite, no matter how small the measuring unit you use. The more closely you look at it, the more detail you find, and the length keeps increasing without bound.","306":"No, a planet or an asteroid would not be considered a fractal. Fractals are mathematical shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They are typically generated by repeating a simple process over and over again. Natural objects like coastlines, trees, and rivers can have fractal-like properties, but actual planets and asteroids do not have the same level of self-similarity and recursive structure that defines true fractals.","307":"Yeah, that's right. The inner workings of a quantum computer are quite complex and fascinating. They rely on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allow them to perform certain computations much faster than classical computers. The qubit, which is the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer, is what enables this quantum advantage.","308":"Entanglement is a fundamental quantum mechanical property where two or more quantum particles become 'entangled' and their states become interdependent, even when separated by a large distance. This means that the state of one particle can instantly affect the state of the other, which is a key principle behind many quantum computing algorithms.","309":"Exactly! That's a great way to think about it. The key idea is that we can use interference to selectively amplify the amplitudes corresponding to the correct solutions, while canceling out the amplitudes for the incorrect solutions. This allows us to guide the quantum system towards the desired output, harnessing the power of superposition and entanglement to perform computations much more efficiently than classical computers.","310":"Sounds like you had a lot of fun at the pool! What was your favorite part of the day there?","311":"Ah, I see. It seems like you have a pretty good memory of the towel's color, even though it was from a while ago. That's impressive! Our memories can sometimes be quite detailed when it comes to specific events or experiences, even if we don't consciously recall them all the time.","312":"That's a great observation! As we accumulate more experiences and knowledge over time, our brains have to be selective about what information to store and what to let go. The brain's capacity is not unlimited, so it prioritizes retaining the most important and meaningful details while allowing less significant information to fade. This is part of the natural process of memory formation and optimization as we grow and learn.","313":"That's right, infinity refers to something that goes on without end, that never stops or has a limit. It's a concept that can be a bit hard to fully grasp, since our human experience is always bounded and finite. But infinity represents the idea of something that has no boundaries or constraints.","314":"I see what you mean. Just because you can see all the numbers inside this worksheet or textbook, that doesn't mean the set of natural numbers is finite. The natural numbers keep going on forever, even if we can't see or write down every single one of them at once. The set of natural numbers is actually an example of an infinite set.","315":"Ah, I see what you're getting at. Yes, when I said 'unlimited,' that can be a bit confusing. With infinity, it doesn't mean there is a never-ending number, but rather a concept that has no limit. It's a way of describing something that goes on without end. Does that help explain what I meant by 'unlimited' in this context?","316":"That's a common issue with quantum computing as well. The principles of quantum mechanics make it challenging to observe and measure the state of a quantum system without disturbing it. This is known as the measurement problem in quantum computing. Researchers are constantly working on techniques to better control and read out the quantum state without collapsing it.","317":"Quantum computing is a new and exciting field of technology that harnesses the unique properties of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and solve problems in ways that are more powerful than traditional computers. It has the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, material science, and drug discovery.","318":"Exactly! In quantum computing, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both heads and tails at the same time. This means it can represent multiple states simultaneously, unlike a classical bit which can only be 0 or 1. This property of superposition is what gives quantum computers their potential power to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.","319":"And it's not just spinning, it's existing in all possible states at the same time. Quantum particles can be in multiple places or states simultaneously until they're observed or measured.","320":"That's the amazing thing about quantum entanglement. Even though the pennies are physically separated, they're still intrinsically linked and their states are perfectly correlated. This fundamental property of quantum systems is what makes quantum computing so powerful and fascinating.","321":"Ah, I see! A black hole is a very fascinating and mysterious object in our universe. It's an extremely dense region of space-time where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The idea of black holes was first proposed by the famous physicist Albert Einstein as a consequence of his theory of general relativity.","322":"You're right, it's not about weight, it's about the amount of mass or material that makes up the object. In the case of a black hole, it has an incredibly dense and concentrated amount of mass, which is what gives it its strong gravitational pull.","323":"Well, if I keep making it smaller and smaller, eventually it would become what we call a black hole. A black hole is an object that is so dense, so massive in a small space, that the gravity becomes so strong that not even light can escape from it. Anything that gets too close to a black hole will be pulled in and never come back out.","324":"Exactly! If the sun were to somehow collapse in on itself, it would create an incredibly dense object called a black hole. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape from it. Once something gets too close to the black hole, it gets pulled in and disappears, unable to ever come back out.","325":"Yes, that's right. The gravity of a black hole is so strong that even light, which travels at the fastest possible speed, cannot escape from it. Once something gets close enough to the black hole, the gravitational pull becomes so intense that it sucks in everything, including light. That's why black holes appear completely dark - no light can come out of them.","326":"No, your computer doesn't think. It just processes data based on the instructions and algorithms programmed into it. In quantum computing, we try to harness the unique properties of quantum mechanics to perform computations in a fundamentally different way.","327":"Exactly! In a classical computer, each bit can only be a 0 or a 1. But in a quantum computer, the bits, called qubits, can be in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.","328":"In the case of quantum sensing, we're talking about measuring things at the quantum level - things like the tiniest magnetic fields, the smallest movements, or even the faintest traces of certain particles. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum sensors can detect and measure phenomena that would be impossible to observe using classical methods.","329":"This is where quantum sensing comes in. Quantum sensors can detect incredibly small changes in things like magnetic fields, temperature, and gravity. By using quantum mechanical effects, they can measure these changes with unprecedented precision.","330":"Exactly! You've got it. Stacking cups may seem like a simple task, but it actually requires a lot of complex skills that robots struggle with. Things like depth perception, dexterity, and fine motor control that come naturally to humans can be incredibly challenging for even the most advanced robots.","331":"Exactly! The robot should be able to pick up the object, move to the designated location, and then gently release or drop it. Moravec's paradox suggests that while tasks like this may seem simple for a robot, they can actually be quite challenging due to the complex sensorimotor skills required.","332":"Yes, that's exactly right. The nitrogen-vacancy center is so sensitive that you can detect the magnetic field of a single electron. To be able to do that, you need to have the sensor really close to the electron, typically within a few nanometers. The close proximity is what allows the nitrogen-vacancy center to pick up on the tiny magnetic field signature of a single electron.","333":"Absolutely. That's a key challenge in quantum sensing. You need to isolate the quantum system from environmental noise and disturbances as much as possible. Even the slightest fluctuations can cause the system to collapse out of the delicate quantum state you're trying to measure. That's why a lot of the research in this field is focused on developing advanced techniques for coherence control and environmental isolation.","334":"That was a good learning experience for us. It reminded us that as we build these sensitive quantum systems, we have to really consider all the different sources of electromagnetic radiation and vibrations that could interfere with our measurements. Even something as common as a local radio station can impact our delicate experiments if we're not careful to properly shield and isolate our quantum sensors. It's a constant challenge to maintain a clean and controlled environment for these systems to operate effectively.","335":"Absolutely, that's the real Holy Grail when it comes to quantum sensing. Being able to detect the subtle quantum fluctuations and use them to measure things that we couldn't before. That's where the real power of this technology lies.","336":"ARPANET was an early precursor to the modern internet. It was developed in the 1960s by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). It was an experimental network that connected major universities and research centers, and it was one of the first packet-switching networks. This early network laid the groundwork for the development of the internet as we know it today.","337":"Packet switching would enable the ability to break down data into smaller chunks, called packets, and send them independently over a network. This allowed for more efficient use of the network's resources, as packets could be routed dynamically based on availability, rather than relying on a dedicated circuit. This was a major innovation that laid the groundwork for the development of the internet as we know it today.","338":"Exactly, that's a key aspect of the internet's design. The request-response model and the ability to route packets dynamically through the network were important features that allowed the internet to be resilient and reliable, even if parts of the network went down.","339":"Yes, that's a great point. The abstraction of the network infrastructure allows developers to focus on building innovative applications without getting bogged down by the complexities of the underlying network. This abstraction is a key reason why the internet has been able to spur so much creativity and growth in technology and services.","340":"You're right, there are some key components that are essential to the functioning of the internet. The seven keys you're referring to are likely the root DNS servers that provide the fundamental address look-up functionality for the internet. These servers translate human-readable domain names, like 'example.com,' into the numerical IP addresses that devices use to communicate with each other. Without these core servers, the internet as we know it would not be able to operate.","341":"Ah, I see. That's the decentralized nature of the internet. There's no central governing body that determines how the internet operates or what content is available. It's a distributed network without a single point of control.","342":"That's a good point. Internet packets can get lost or delayed at various stages of their journey across the network. Routers, switches, and other network devices can sometimes drop packets if they're overloaded or encounter errors. The underlying infrastructure isn't always perfectly reliable, so some packet loss is inevitable.","343":"The reason I'd say three is because the most basic fractal, the Sierpinski triangle, is defined by three distinct shapes that are repeated at different scales to create the overall fractal pattern.","344":"Exactly! When you crumpled the paper, you created a three-dimensional object out of a two-dimensional sheet. This is a key concept in fractals - the idea that you can take a simple shape and repeat it at different scales to create a complex, three-dimensional structure. Fractals are self-similar patterns that exhibit this property of scale invariance, meaning they look the same at different magnification levels.","345":"And if I cut that box in half again, how many boxes do I need to cover the line?","346":"Exactly! Perlin noise is a procedural noise function that generates a pseudo-random, continuous gradient field. It's widely used in computer graphics and animation to create realistic-looking textures and terrain. By using Perlin noise, you can generate infinitely detailed patterns that look natural, even at different scales. It's a powerful tool for creating fractal-like structures and organic-looking elements in digital environments.","347":"Absolutely. Infinity is a concept that can be challenging to grasp, but it's also incredibly fascinating. When talking to students about it, it's important to start with the basics and build up their understanding gradually. Things like the difference between finite and infinite sets, the various types of infinity, and how they relate to real-world situations can really capture their curiosity and spark deeper discussions.","348":"That sounds like a fascinating area of study. How are you planning to approach this topic in your research? What specific hypotheses or research questions are you exploring?","349":"So tell me, what are your thoughts on the role of memory in our perceptions and social judgments? I'm curious to hear your perspective on how memory shapes the way we make sense of the world around us.","350":"That's a really important point. The emotional response we have to a memory can have a huge impact on how we interpret and act on that memory. If the memory is associated with a strong negative emotion like fear or anger, it can lead us to make very different decisions than if the memory evokes a positive emotion. Understanding how emotion influences memory and decision-making is crucial, especially in cases of trauma or other disruptions to memory.","351":"That's because the shapes in Minecraft are made up of discrete blocks, rather than continuous mathematical functions like fractals. When you zoom in, you just see the individual blocks that make up the shape, rather than seeing the fractal pattern emerge.","352":"Subdivision surfaces are a way of creating smooth, organic shapes using fractals. The basic idea is to start with a simple 3D mesh, and then recursively subdivide each triangle or polygon, adding more detail with each iteration. This allows you to create very complex, highly detailed 3D models from a relatively simple starting point. It's a powerful technique that's widely used in computer graphics and animation.","353":"The key idea with subdivision surfaces is to take these sharp polygon shapes and iteratively smooth them out. By repeatedly cutting off the corners and adding new vertices, the shape gradually becomes smoother and more curved, approximating a continuous surface. This allows us to create visually appealing and realistic shapes on the computer, without having to work with complex fractal geometries directly.","354":"And how do you feel about the role of the internet and technology in your daily life as a student?","355":"Well, your home network typically connects to the larger internet through your internet service provider. They have equipment and infrastructure that connects your home network to the broader network of networks that makes up the internet. So when you connect a device in your home to the internet, it's actually going through your internet service provider's network and then accessing the wider internet.","356":"Yes, that's exactly right. The internet is made up of a vast network of underwater cables and satellite links that connect different parts of the world. These cables and connections allow data to be transmitted across the globe, enabling us to communicate and access information from anywhere. The undersea cables you mentioned are a critical part of this global infrastructure, providing high-speed data transmission between continents.","357":"The internet actually uses a combination of both wired and wireless connections. While the long-distance communication between continents and countries is primarily done through the undersea cables you mentioned, the final connection to homes and devices is often wireless. This is done through technologies like WiFi and cellular networks, which allow devices to connect to the broader internet without the need for physical cables.","358":"Well, when you request to watch Vampire Diaries on Netflix, your device communicates with a nearby Netflix server that has a copy of that show. The server then streams the video data directly to your device, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted viewing experience. The server is able to identify the appropriate content to deliver based on the specific title you've selected. This allows Netflix to efficiently provide the video you want without any scrambling or interruptions.","359":"That's a really interesting challenge. The Moravec's Paradox suggests that the kinds of tasks that seem effortless for humans, like manipulating objects, are actually much harder for robots to accomplish compared to higher-level cognitive tasks. Can you talk more about why you think those types of deformable, complex foods are so difficult to work with for robots?","360":"As you know, Moravec's paradox is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence. It states that tasks that are easy for humans, such as vision and motor control, are actually very challenging for AI systems, while tasks that are difficult for humans, like logical reasoning, are relatively easy for AI.","361":"That's a great intuition! Quantum sensing refers to using the unique properties of quantum systems, like superposition and entanglement, to measure physical quantities with unprecedented precision. This can be used to detect extremely small signals, like the magnetic fields from the human brain or gravitational waves from the cosmos. Quantum sensors can be incredibly sensitive, opening up new possibilities for applications in science, medicine, and technology.","362":"I'm studying quantum sensing. It's a rapidly-evolving field that uses principles of quantum mechanics to create highly sensitive and precise sensors. These sensors can measure things like magnetic fields, gravity, and time with incredible accuracy, which has all sorts of applications in fields like navigation, astronomy, and fundamental physics research.","363":"Yes, that's exactly what I'm studying. The spin of electrons in certain materials, like nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, can exhibit quantum phenomena even at room temperature. This makes them promising candidates for developing highly sensitive quantum sensors that can operate without the need for cryogenic cooling.","364":"Superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics where a particle or system can exist in multiple states or configurations simultaneously. In the context of quantum computing, this allows for the processing of information in a fundamentally different way compared to classical computers. The ability to leverage superposition and other quantum phenomena, like entanglement, is what gives quantum computers the potential to vastly outperform classical computers on certain types of problems.","365":"Yes, an atomic clock is a type of quantum sensor. It uses the quantum properties of atoms to measure time with extremely high precision. The oscillations of atoms are used as a reference to keep time, and this quantum-based timekeeping is much more accurate than traditional mechanical clocks.","366":"Well, that's just the beginning. Quantum sensing takes this idea of using ultra-precise quantum measurements and applies it to a whole range of other fields. For example, you could use quantum sensors to detect tiny magnetic fields, which could have applications in medical imaging or even in the search for dark matter. Or you could use them to measure gravity with unprecedented accuracy, which could lead to better earthquake monitoring and even new ways to explore the universe.","367":"Namina, that's a lovely name! It's great to meet you. Now, let me tell you a bit about quantum sensing. This is an exciting field of science that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to measure and detect things with incredible precision.","368":"Ah yes, that's a great point. Quantum sensing can also detect physical touch or contact. The quantum sensors are so sensitive that they can even pick up the slightest physical interactions.","369":"But with quantum sensing, you can actually see much deeper into the surface and detect things that you wouldn't be able to see with a regular magnifying glass. Quantum sensors can measure things like magnetic fields, electric fields, and even gravity in ways that give you a much more detailed and comprehensive picture of what's happening beneath the surface.","370":"This is what quantum sensing is all about. We use quantum phenomena, like the wave-like behavior of particles, to probe and measure the properties of an object without disturbing it too much.","371":"You could just send the messages directly, right? But what if you wanted to prove something about the messages without revealing their contents? That's where zero-knowledge proofs come in. With a zero-knowledge proof, you can prove a statement is true without sharing the actual information that makes it true.","372":"But zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic technique that allow one party to prove to another party that they know a specific piece of information, without revealing that information. It's a fascinating concept that seems to defy logic at first glance.","373":"That's an interesting project! The Magellanic Clouds are fascinating systems to study. Do you have any insights on whether the Large Magellanic Cloud has a supermassive black hole at its center? That's been a topic of debate among astronomers.","374":"That's true, but there are actually other ways black holes can form as well. For instance, supermassive black holes can form at the center of galaxies through the gradual accumulation of matter over time. Primordial black holes may have also formed shortly after the Big Bang, even before the first stars appeared. So while star collapse is the most common pathway, it's not the only way black holes can come into existence.","375":"Yes, that's a good way to think about it. Black holes are like the ultimate gravitational friends - they can exert such a strong pull on everything around them, including even light.","376":"Exactly, it would be a supermassive black hole. A black hole formed by the merger of our sun and the other black hole. The mass of that resulting black hole would be massive, potentially millions or even billions of times the mass of our sun, making it a supermassive black hole.","377":"Exactly! In the context of zero-knowledge proofs, the randomness becomes a feature rather than a bug. By using randomness, the prover can demonstrate knowledge of a secret without revealing any information about it. This is the core idea behind zero-knowledge proofs - to prove the validity of a statement without disclosing the underlying secret.","378":"The ability to outsource computations to the cloud, while preserving privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, could unlock a whole new realm of applications. Imagine being able to perform complex calculations on sensitive data without ever revealing the underlying information. This could revolutionize areas like financial transactions, medical diagnostics, and even secure voting systems.","379":"That's a really fascinating perspective. I'm very interested in this idea of how the brain is more than just the individual regions, but really the dynamic interactions between those regions. Can you say a bit more about how this network-based approach has changed the way we understand memory processes specifically? I imagine it has revealed some new insights that the more localized approaches may have missed.","380":"So in a way, memory is not about storing all the details, but rather about having a robust model that can generate those details on the fly when needed. The model itself becomes the efficient representation of the information, rather than trying to store everything explicitly. It's a more economical and flexible approach to how our minds work.","381":"Zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a certain piece of information, without actually revealing that information. It's a way to verify a statement without providing any additional knowledge.","382":"Now, the key idea behind zero-knowledge proofs is that I can prove to you that these two colors are different, without actually revealing what the specific colors are. In other words, I can convince you that I know the colors are different, without having to tell you what the actual colors are.","383":"Well, if I can show you a proof that demonstrates I've colored the entire map correctly, without revealing anything about the actual colors I used, that would be a zero-knowledge proof. This allows me to convince you that I've solved the problem without disclosing any additional information beyond the fact that I have a valid solution.","384":"Well, the key idea behind zero-knowledge proofs is that you can prove something is true without revealing any additional information. It's a really fascinating concept, and it has lots of important applications in cryptography and security.","385":"Exactly! The colors I showed you before don't work with these new colors. The previous solution doesn't apply here, so we need to find a new approach to prove the statement without revealing any additional information.","386":"Zero-knowledge proofs have a wide range of fascinating applications, from privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like ZCash to secure software verification. The fundamental idea is that one party can prove to another party that they know a certain piece of information, without revealing that information itself. This allows for all kinds of efficient and confidential interactions.","387":"A choice function is a way to select a single element from a set or collection. It allows you to choose one item from a set, and it's an important concept in set theory and decision theory.","388":"Ah, I see. That's an interesting perspective. Could you tell me more about why you believe the axiom of choice? I'm curious to hear your reasoning on this fundamental question in set theory.","389":"Fractals are fascinating mathematical shapes that exhibit a repeating pattern at every scale. They are often found in nature, such as in the branching patterns of trees or the intricate designs of snowflakes.","390":"One way to do this is by using a mathematical concept called a fractal. A fractal is a repeating pattern that looks similar at different scales. Trees are a great example of a natural fractal - if you look closely at a tree, you can see that the branches and twigs have a similar branching pattern as the entire tree.","391":"And that's the key idea behind fractals. Each part of a fractal shape is a smaller version of the whole. This self-similarity at different scales is what makes fractals so fascinating and complex.","392":"Well, that's how fractals work! A fractal is a pattern that repeats at smaller and smaller scales, like the branches of a tree. So if you take the basic shape of your tree and repeat it over and over, you can create a whole forest of similar-looking trees without having to draw each one individually. It's a really efficient way to generate complex, natural-looking patterns.","393":"So when you're drawing fractals on a computer, you need to use a programming language to create the algorithms that generate the fractal patterns. This allows you to precisely control the mathematical rules and repetition that define the fractal's structure.","394":"That's a good point. The low data requirements of IoT devices can help keep the complexity of managing them manageable, even as the number of devices scales up. The key is to design the infrastructure and protocols to efficiently handle the distributed nature of IoT, without introducing too much overhead. With the right architectural choices, the operational complexity can remain relatively flat as the number of connected devices grows.","395":"That's great that you get to keep learning new things. Can you tell me more about how you've been applying ideas from quantum optics to your work on quantum computing? What are some of the key insights or breakthroughs that have come out of that crossover?","396":"But in reality, the opposite is often true. The tasks that are easy for humans, like recognizing images or understanding natural language, are actually very difficult for machines to do. This phenomenon is known as Moravec's Paradox.","397":"Let's say I have a simple task for you - can you take this pen and write your name on this piece of paper for me?","398":"Well, the Moravec's paradox suggests that it's actually much harder for a computer to perform that simple task than it is for a human. Humans can easily pick up a penny without even thinking about it, but for a computer to do the same thing is incredibly difficult.","399":"Okay, now try to complete the same task with your eyes closed. Let's see how you do.","400":"That's the amazing thing about fractals, isn't it? Their complexity and beauty can emerge from such simple algorithms and processes. Even young people can create these mesmerizing visual patterns by just experimenting with a few lines of code. The fractal geometry really showcases how incredibly intricate and fascinating the natural world can be at a fundamental level.","401":"Exactly, that's the key. Fractals are all about scaling and self-similarity at different levels. Once you grasp that fundamental concept, the whole world of fractals opens up in a really fascinating way.","402":"Absolutely. He wanted to empower people to create their own art, just like Bob Ross did with his accessible painting techniques. But at the same time, Ken's work with fractals captured the inherent complexity and beauty of nature. He found a way to make the power of fractals available to everyone, just as Bob Ross made painting accessible.","403":"That's a good observation. Our memory is not perfect, and it can sometimes distort or forget details over time. The way we store and retrieve memories is complex and can be influenced by various factors like emotions, context, and the passage of time. Even though our memories may not be entirely accurate, they still serve an important function in helping us make sense of our experiences and inform our understanding of the world.","404":"That's a great example! Your memory of the 'meh' orange juice from your childhood could shape your expectations and perceptions when you try a new orange juice on vacation. The contrast could make you appreciate the new, better-tasting orange juice more. So in that case, your memory would be useful in helping you form a more nuanced opinion and experience with orange juice.","405":"Excellent choice! Pixie sticks are definitely a tasty treat. And you're right, that decision was based on your past experiences and preferences, which your memory helped you recall. This is a great example of how our memories guide our choices and shape our future behaviors. Well done, Dylan!","406":"That's a great way to think about it! Math is all about solving complex problems in clever and efficient ways. One example of that is something called 'zero-knowledge proofs'. Can you guess what those are?","407":"That's where zero-knowledge proofs come in! I can prove to you that I know where it is, without actually telling you the location. Let me show you how it works.","408":"Great, so you can see the puffin behind the poster, right? That means I was able to prove to you that I know where the puffin is, without actually revealing its location. This is the essence of a zero-knowledge proof - I can convince you that I have certain information, without giving you that information directly.","409":"Zero-knowledge proofs are an important concept in cryptography and computer science. They allow you to prove that you have certain information or knowledge, without actually revealing that information. This has many practical applications, such as in secure online transactions, voting systems, and protecting sensitive data. By using zero-knowledge proofs, we can ensure that information is kept private and secure, while still being able to verify that certain claims or statements are true.","410":"But with a zero-knowledge proof, you can prove to the computer that you know the password without actually revealing the password itself. That way, even if a hacker gets into the system, they won't be able to access your account because they don't have the actual password. It's like showing the computer a secret handshake instead of giving them the key to your house.","411":"Imagine if you could log in to your accounts without revealing your username or password. That's what a zero-knowledge proof allows you to do. You can prove your identity without exposing any sensitive information. It's like being able to prove you're you without having to show your ID card.","412":"Moravec's paradox is a concept in artificial intelligence that refers to the unexpected difficulty of replicating certain human abilities, particularly those related to low-level sensory and motor skills, in computer systems. Despite our advanced technological capabilities, these seemingly simple tasks that come naturally to humans have proven challenging to replicate in machines.","413":"Yes, that's a good point. When it comes to robotic systems, the data they work with is often in the form of sensor readings, joint angles, and other numerical values that represent the state of the robot and its environment. This lends itself well to machine learning approaches, where the algorithms can learn patterns and relationships directly from this numerical data.","414":"That's really impressive. The ability to detect and control individual nuclear spins around a single electron is a remarkable achievement in quantum sensing. It really showcases the incredible sensitivity and precision that these techniques can offer. As the field continues to advance, I'm excited to see what other breakthroughs and applications emerge from this rapidly evolving area of research.","415":"Absolutely, the increased number of researchers working in the field of quantum sensing is a key driver for advancements. With more minds dedicated to the challenge, we're likely to see rapid progress and breakthroughs that can revolutionize various applications, from navigation to medical imaging and beyond. The diversity of perspectives and approaches that this growing scientific community brings will be invaluable in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with quantum sensing technologies.","416":"Can you give me an example of something that represents infinity for you?","417":"Exactly! That's correct. If we have a second guest, then two plus infinity would still be equal to infinity. The number of guests, whether it's one, two, or any finite number, doesn't change the fact that the total number of guests is still infinite. The addition of a finite number to infinity simply results in the same infinity.","418":"No, the hotels are separate and can't accommodate each other's guests. We need to find a way to move some guests from one hotel to the other to make room for the new arrivals. Let's think through this step-by-step.","419":"Exactly! Two infinities are equal to infinity. The concept of infinity can be quite counterintuitive, but the properties of infinity are fascinating to explore. Even though we have doubled the number of guests, the total number of guests is still infinite. This highlights how the usual rules of arithmetic don't necessarily apply when dealing with the infinite.","420":"Oh, that's a great movie! What do you like about it?","421":"That's a good start! The video would travel through a series of connected devices and networks to get from one place to another. Let me walk you through the process step-by-step:","422":"Exactly! That's a great point. Having multiple paths available means that if one route is not working or is congested, you can take an alternative path to get to your destination. This redundancy and resilience is a key feature of the internet and other distributed networks. It helps ensure that the network can continue to function even if certain parts are down or overloaded.","423":"Lettuce talk about the internet!","424":"As you know, the internet has evolved significantly over the past couple of decades, and there's a lot to discuss about its impact on our lives. What would you like to focus on today? I'm happy to provide an overview of some of the key developments and trends.","425":"That's right, black holes are incredibly dense objects with a strong gravitational pull. They are formed when a massive star collapses in on itself at the end of its life cycle. The immense gravity of a black hole is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. This unique property of black holes has led to various theories and insights about the nature of the universe, space, and time.","426":"That's a good general definition. A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs, where each input is paired with exactly one output. In other words, a function takes an input value and maps it to a unique output value. This one-to-one correspondence is a key property of functions.","427":"Okay, let's think through that. The integers do contain more elements than the natural numbers, but how can we show that they have different 'sizes' of infinity? The key is to find a way to match up, or establish a one-to-one correspondence, between the elements of the two sets. Let's try that.","428":"Exactly! We would match negative one with the natural number two. And then we can continue this correspondence, where negative two matches with three, negative three matches with four, and so on. This shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and the natural numbers, proving they are the same size infinity.","429":"Exactly! You've got it. The idea is that every rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, and those integers correspond to the x and y coordinates of the points on this integer lattice. So by counting these points, we can effectively count all the rational numbers.","430":"Precisely! The pair of integers (3, 2) is represented by the natural number 25 in this encoding. This shows that the set of rational numbers, which can be represented as pairs of integers, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. This was a key insight that led to the discovery of the countability of the rational numbers.","431":"Exactly, it's a fascinating result that the size of infinity of the rational numbers and the natural numbers are the same. This is a powerful insight that was only discovered relatively recently in the history of mathematics. It really highlights the profound and often counterintuitive nature of infinity.","432":"This means that the real numbers are a larger set than the natural numbers. In other words, the real numbers are 'uncountable,' while the natural numbers are 'countable.' This insight was a major breakthrough in mathematics, and it has far-reaching implications for our understanding of infinity and the nature of mathematical reality.","433":"Well, the study of different sizes of infinity has profound implications for mathematics, computer science, and even the nature of the universe. For example, it helps us understand the limits of what can be computed or measured, and it raises deep questions about the structure of reality. While the practical applications may not always be immediately obvious, this fundamental knowledge about infinity underpins many of the most important and cutting-edge developments in science and technology.","434":"That's a good point. The speed and efficiency of the computational hardware is a key factor in training complex neural networks. With traditional computing, it can take a very long time to train some models. This is where quantum computing comes in - the ability to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers could be a game-changer for machine learning and AI.","435":"You know, quantum computing has some really interesting implications for machine learning. The ability to process and analyze huge amounts of data in parallel could lead to breakthroughs in areas like pattern recognition, optimization, and simulation. And because quantum computers can exploit quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, they may be able to tackle certain types of machine learning problems more efficiently than classical computers.","436":"And that's the key idea behind quantum computing. The ability to harness the quantum mechanical properties of a system, like superposition, to perform computations in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. This opens up the potential for solving certain types of problems much more efficiently than classical algorithms.","437":"Well, the key to encoding information in a quantum computer is to use quantum mechanical properties like the spin or polarization of a particle. Instead of using the classical binary bits of 0 and 1, we use what are called 'qubits' which can be in a superposition of 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows us to perform certain computations much more efficiently than classical computers.","438":"In quantum computing, the goal is not just to get a probabilistic result, but to develop algorithms that give a deterministic output. This means that the outcome of the computation is always the same, rather than a random sample from a probability distribution. The challenge is to find ways to use the unique properties of quantum mechanics, like superposition and entanglement, to create algorithms that reliably produce the desired result every time.","439":"Absolutely, the Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers and Grover's algorithm for database search are two of the most well-known quantum algorithms that can provide exponential speedup compared to their classical counterparts. We also expect quantum computers to be highly effective in simulating quantum mechanical systems, which could have significant implications for fields like chemistry and materials

That was a clever play on words. Say, since we've got a good rapport going, what do you think about the latest developments in technology and how they're shaping our online experiences these days? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.","424":"I'm glad we have the chance to catch up. To be honest, I'm not sure I have much to say about the internet and how it's changed over the years. I feel like that's not really the main reason we're here today. Why don't you tell me what's been going on with you lately? I'd be interested to hear about what's new in your life.","425":null,"426":null,"427":null,"428":null,"429":null,"430":null,"431":null,"432":null,"433":null,"434":"Yes, that's true. The computational power and speed of the hardware can have a significant impact on how long it takes to train complex neural network models. Traditional computing can be quite slow for certain tasks, but emerging technologies like quantum computing hold promise to greatly accelerate the training process by enabling faster calculation of complex operations. This could be a major breakthrough for pushing the boundaries of machine learning and AI.","435":null,"436":"That's right, the ability to use quantum superposition is the core concept behind quantum computing. By manipulating the quantum states of a system, we can perform calculations in a completely different way compared to classical computers. This has the potential to unlock new ways of solving certain types of problems much more
