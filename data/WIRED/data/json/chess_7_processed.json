Like it can do millions of searches a second. I think some of the components of the evaluation function map to some of the things humans do when they look at a chess board, right? When they're thinking about the king being unsafe. Even that emotion you describe, I feel uncomfortable. Like I feel uncomfortable whenever I've castled and I push that G pawn or something. But that feeling translates to some of the components of the evaluation function that Stockfish uses. Humans don't have this luxury of searching millions of nodes a second."

These deep neural nets are kind of like black boxes. So we've come up with interesting ways to probe at them to get an idea of, okay, what is actually is going on that is different about this person or different about that person? We had like a style vector for each person. We can compare those, see where you defer, and try to map those back to human understandable chess concepts because that's the key, right? If I just tell you, Oh, they defer in the third number and the fifth number, you'll be like, What does that even mean, right? But if I can tell you, Oh I think this person worries more about their king's safety or sacrifices their center at the cost of protecting their king, or something like that, some kind of trade-off, then you might be able to understand what's going on there. So that's what we're trying to do now with these style vectors, and the fun thing about having numbers representing people is that you can add them together. You can mix them."

So the move is bringing out the bishop, Bringing out the bishop. so you don't get locked. I play that move, but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to try to undermine the center. It's not commonly played at the highest level. If you study master games, this is probably one in every six games or something compared to, right? So now we go down a totally different path. We're taking a totally different train to our destination, but just this undermining of the position, you know, splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both, that does wonders at intermediate and early advanced level. This move, despite it being move three, according to databases, already gives black like a 53% chance of winning, which is crazy because normally white is about 52%, right? White just doesn't know what to do about this move."

They've shown sparks of creativity that have inspired the way humans play, but I agree with you that, right now, you know, you look at the the TCAC competitions, and they're just kind of getting better and better and a little bit better, a little bit better, a little bit more data, maybe a deeper neural network, and, you know, these advances I don't find that interesting. I'm more interested in trying to get better and better at creating human-like presence and human-like avatars when it comes to chess or when it comes to other games. So I feel like, you know, within five years, we'll probably have a lot of human-like entities that we can interact in in virtual settings, not just because of the rise of large language models and the ability to converse and speak and produce text like humans but hopefully the ability to produce actions like humans, too."
