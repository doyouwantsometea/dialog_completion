I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity. And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis. What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?"

And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp."

What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false. So this is a little bit confusing. The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it. So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem. So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this. If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?"

And so yes, I think that if we change the foundations, we would change mathematics. But I think that's also very humbling in that it's not that we're sort of discovering a universal truth, it's we are humans constructing meaning. It's abstract art in a sense. There is something there even if you can't see all the pieces for particular things. And I think that it's really fascinating. I was thinking about this on the drive here. The way that I interact with infinity I mentioned earlier is sometimes we, in number theory especially, we say, does this type of equation have infinitely many solutions? And then the question is are there infinitely many, are there not? Or are there infinitely many twin primes? These are sort of interesting ideas but I don't think that knowing if it's infinite or not is necessarily the most interesting thing for me. What's been most interesting to me is all the math that gets developed to be able to answer that question."
