                    "text": "Okay. The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience. Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes. Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right? So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day."

                    "text": "For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep."

                    "author": "Explainer",
                    "text": "You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing. In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?"

That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain."
