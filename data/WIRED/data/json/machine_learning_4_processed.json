It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable. Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation. We don't do this every day. But we probably still eat breakfast. We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner. You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time. And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us."

So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos. But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us. And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions. Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today. And that's something that is still uniquely human. Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative. They're not going to invent. They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go. That's up to us."
