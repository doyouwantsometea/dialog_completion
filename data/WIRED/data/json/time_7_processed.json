You can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space, but making that one change, you could have this radical impact?"

Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time."

But at least in this setup, which we don't know is true about our universe, but if it were, then you could have a real-time conversation over arbitrarily large distances, which is--"

Saying that something is emergent will make full sense only when we have some concrete model in which space and time emergent, in which we make sense of this non-space, non-time description of a theory. I don't know if we are still at this stage in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario because, often, I tell my students, the greatest scientific revolution has been not in the 20th century, has not been quantum mechanics nor general relativity nor special relativity, that's been the passage from qualitative description of nature, the quantitative one. When you pass from asking how to how much, then you understand something."

One is that, professionally, we use spacetime diagrams, Penrose diagrams, a lot of diagrams where space and times are just two axis on a board. And when we describe a particle, we have a line that goes up in time. By the way, this image also is the last image in Pros, the last page, there is this beautiful sentence, which is also true, saying that if he has the time, he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extending time much longer than in space. If C equal to 1, that's very true. So this idea that you have a continuum, and time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone, is very practical. It's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics. When in the approach of various people including Hartle that collaborated a lot with Hawking. There is this idea that what you describe is a history, it's not a particular moment in time, but it's an evolution. This history treats space and time on a more equal basis."
