Even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas. There are low temperature, higher density plasmas. There are of course the astrophysical plasmas, and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas. They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas. They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro-instabilities."

And this has a lot of advantages for us, because charged particles want to follow the magnetic field lines. But things start to get really interesting when we're no longer thinking about individual particle motions in the plasma. And instead we start to think about collective effects."

Instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately. We have to use a full blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving. Because we have collisions. So we have to add collisions back in to understand and track how all the particles are moving, and how these collective motions, this turbulence can get kicked up. So that's pretty intractable, right?"

And the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism. the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system. Being able to study it, measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to overcome."

So what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop a charged particle into a strong external magnetic field, the Lorentz force bends that particle's trajectory into a helix. And so now if we know that wherever the field line is going that particle is following it in this helical, in this corkscrew trajectory, we can say aha, I no longer have to worry about following that particle's velocity around in a circle, 'cause at every point in time I know it's going in a circle."

But as we started to make more and more measurements and build higher and higher basically performing devices, we started to see nothing is matching the expected performance. And that's because people thought that Coulomb collisions between the particles, just interactions of charged particles, would dominate cross-field transport, right? What happens with turbulence is it in enhances the transport of particles, because now we're not just talking about this random walk of collisions, we're talking about conduction, convection, eddy, structures, microstructures, flow generation, very complex soup of activity."
