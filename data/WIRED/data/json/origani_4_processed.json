Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this. If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns."

We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces. Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?"

                    "text": "If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that. And if I had another one up here, I could make all three. And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists. In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns. And let's just try going along. All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons. So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want."
