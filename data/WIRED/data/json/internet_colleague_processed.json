I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP, the Routing Control Platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things, that we could compute things in data centers. I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of SDN and where it's come since then."

And they had the idea of having a computer running a program tell a distributed set of telephony switches what to do. But the idea was like, wow, it was kind of a revelation, like what would that look like if we did that? Not for the whole internet, but at least AT&T's part of the internet. So in other words, use software instead of distributed protocols to to tell the network what to do."

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists, let's say within a single provider backbone, or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus. There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks. But one other trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other, you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google or Microsoft or other large cloud providers, where even, you might only go through two networks"

And so they can decide, like the Great Firewall of China can decide, they don't wanna let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country. So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request for a particular domain name, they say, Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website. They can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country. And so encryption plays a role in helping people keep their privacy or prevent surveillance, but it's not perfect. It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount about what people are doing, even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's written."

I think when you think just about networking, it really is often just one part of the IT, the information technology ecosystem. Is there's often compute and storage as well. And so, I think now there's an opportunity to have all of those parts of the infrastructure work together towards an even higher level goal. And so I think it's a really exciting time to be in the field 'cause now, the plumbing is getting close to the application in a way that it wasn't before."
