We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor. And those chips are what goes into all of these objects. What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area. They're called transistors. It's a switch. Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage."

You can do logic with them. Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip. Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?"

                    "text": "You have to make it smaller. Exactly. But here's the problem. So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel. And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish. So they're very thin transistors. The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay? So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across. And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly. It's just a huge feat in engineering. But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future. And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now."

                    "text": "Exactly. So these are made using a technique called lithography. You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer. Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it. And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip. It's not just the size of the mask that matters. It's the wavelength of the light that's used. We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people."

When we saw the picture of all of the little ones, it's like a city, it's crazy how simple and complex it is at the same time."
