So it is a system that you can add data to and not change previous data within it. It does this through a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered, or distributed, parties that do not need to trust each other but just need to trust the mechanism by which their consensus is arrived at. In the case of blockchain, it relies on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network."

And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars. You have all of these batteries. That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right. Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times. If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes. Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware. I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances. It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve. And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible."

They are an idea with enormous potential significance down the road. However, the promise of the initial coin offering has been kind of hijacked into this string of like basically pump and dump scams or sort of desperate gold rush schemes. The faster that we can shift from this fantasy that it is going to make you rich in a sort of, you know, 1920s tulip bubble kind of way, is the sooner that we can get into people, honestly, and I mean this like with all the hope in the world, people being disappointed in blockchain. It's like, oh, I didn't get rich. It's just being used now to make it easier to transact goods and services safely across borders. This isn't exciting at all. And then we'll see that become part of the everyday infrastructure of the world in a way that I think will be very significant. But I think it is now, almost every aspect of it that's connected with the concept of money is wildly over-hyped, and--"

One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge. We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve. We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own. And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust."

My wallet will automatically not touch money that has been exchanged with the following as a sort of very extreme way of cutting those things out. But there's also ways in which, I think, that could be applied to clearing out the entire logistics process of many kinds of bad actors. Trying to make a supply chain better, in some ways, relies a lot on whose version of better that is and exactly kind of what gets qualified but also how that is quantified within say some kind of like smart contract system. There's multiple ways that I can see this backfiring. One is the ways in which that is implemented, for example, leaving certain kinds of bad behavior untouched or unanalyzed. Or one that feels even more dire to me in some ways is creating an extremely inflexible, like 'cause human contracts, legal contracts, are actually very flexible. There's a lot of kind of room to renegotiate. There's lots of conditions."
