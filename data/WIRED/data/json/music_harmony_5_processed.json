All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way. Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?"

(both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it. F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah. (laughter) D minor seven with a G in it. C softs, or minor, nice. B flat major. G seven, F sharp major seven. Home, yeah! I like that. So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories. Cool, yeah. Nice, man."
