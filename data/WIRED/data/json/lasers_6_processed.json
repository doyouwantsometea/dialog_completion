We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end. So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?"

It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt. So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab. We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter. So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter? So we still have six orders. So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23. So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder. I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over. We need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum."
