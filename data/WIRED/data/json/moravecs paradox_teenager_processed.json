It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did."

There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are."
