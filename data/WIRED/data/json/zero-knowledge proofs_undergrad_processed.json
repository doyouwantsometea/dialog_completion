But if you can solve it, you can solve any problem that's in the class NP. And that includes a vast number of problems. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna use an NP-complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero-knowledge proof. And the specific Np-complete problem that we're gonna be looking at is called map three-coloring. Okay, so here we have a map. Okay. And these are a bunch of countries. And we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border. That's what makes a map like this validly colored. And now you might think, well, why should we care? It turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an NP-complete problem. And it turns out that, you know, maybe what you really wanna do, is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right? That would be cool."
