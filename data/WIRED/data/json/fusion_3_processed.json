Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun, which is a star, inside a jar, but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of, and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container. So fusion is about bringing things together. That's what fusing means. When those fusion reactions occur, a new particle is created, and energy is also released. Do you know what an atom is?"

We want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity. And there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about. Have you heard of gravity?"

And so if we want to take those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy, that we can use to make electricity, then we have to actually overcome that strong electrostatic force that just want to make those balls bounce off of each other. There's another force which you might be familiar with, which is like a magnetic force."

We don't have to touch this very, very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields. You are so smart. I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject."
