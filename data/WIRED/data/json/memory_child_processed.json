I asked you about the towel. It doesn't come to mind immediately, but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world. And for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works. And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you, but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there, all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects, your brain kind of decided letting go of all that information."

So when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life a while ago, where do those memories come from?"

There's another part of the brain. It's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going for memory. So memory for things that are really scary, it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong. Why do you think it might be important to remember scary things?"
