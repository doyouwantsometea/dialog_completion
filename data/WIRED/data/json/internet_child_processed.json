Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers. And the internet is something that connects them. And right now, the internet is just one communication link. And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer. So the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another. Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it? Right? It's just one thing. Should we add some more friends in?"

There are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source, the place that's sending the information, to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together.

And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks. And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing, but more about the rules about communication. That's governed by something that are called protocols. Are you up for one?"

The computer that you are using say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return. In the internet, there are protocols everywhere. So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other. This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other. But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet."
