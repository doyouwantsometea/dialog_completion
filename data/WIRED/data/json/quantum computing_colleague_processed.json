He said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable. In a quantum system, when you look at it or make measurements, it can change in a way that's beyond your control. We have the following task, build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts."

The basis of the RSA encryption is the most commonly used thing on the internet. First we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor's algorithm on that scale. Second, there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don't use factoring and I don't think anybody has to be concerned at the moment. And in the end, quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement. If you have a quantum communication channel you can encode information and send it through there and it's provably secure based on the laws of physics."
