The most confusing, mysterious side of the game, and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board. You gotta have to know how to convert positions, defend positions, understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that. So for you, what do you struggle with the most?"

It's a move totally on the edge, but nobody is gonna stop your bishop from going to that diagonal, and then you're threatening a tactic. You're threatening a skewer. You would hit my queen and my rook. Stronger piece in front, weaker peace in back, and then you would be guaranteed to win some material. Just like little pattern recognition in the middle game. So for the future, you're gonna have a game where your opponent makes the same trade early, right? They trade their dark-squared bishop, and you can activate it like that, but in this game, you focused on the center, which was totally fine also."

And we wanna get to a situation where you knew this move was gonna happen, and the next I'm gonna come here, and then now what can I do? I can bring both my rooks, and now I have no problems, right? Now I have both knights, queen, rooks. So we need to get to a point where we see that coming, and we're not just focusing on our own plans, but that's not always easy. So with a pawn here, that disrupts my plan, right? Because now this move fails to-"

It's not checkers. You don't have to take me, and I don't have to take you. So we can do something called keeping the tension. We're just having a staring contest here among the pawns. So I'm gonna ask you, do you think it's better for black to capture this pawn or keep the tension? Just slide the rook over and threaten to push the pawn here, which would be a tactic and a fork."

You used kind of like a heuristic, right? Well, black has two knights. So black prefers the position closed because decide what the bishops wants to be able to see the whole board. Yes, exactly, but your opponent disagreed with you and took this pawn because that's just what intermediate players do. They see they can take something. Pawn for pawn. What the heck?
