Right now I'm doing my PhD in the field of active galactic nuclei, which are the most luminous compact objects in the universe, and it's because of the extreme accretion that we're seeing onto these super massive black holes. We don't have such a simple picture, that this central black hole is surrounded by this donut shaped torus of material, and that all these different classes of AGN simply arise from a viewing angle effect of this torus, as a very oversimplified geometry, and this--"

They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies. So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to. And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time. But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study."

We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--"

It's a difficult thing, but, you know, I think we really need to get a clear picture, to be looking at wavelengths, of course."
