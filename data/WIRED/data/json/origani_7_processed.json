Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states."

When you have an origami crease pattern like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment, the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this, or on a larger scale, or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale. Engineers, in particular robotics engineers, are turning to origami toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really, really small. This looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work."

                    "text": "New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities. An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori. It's got a three-dimensional structure. If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat. This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong."

We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications."

When I look at origami, when I look at all these applications or just all these different origami folds, I see structure. Math is really about patterns. The patterns that we see in origami are reflecting some kind of mathematical structure and we don't quite know yet what all of that structure is and if we can tie a mathematical structure that's already well-studied to something we see happening in origami, then we can use the math tools right away to help solve the engineering problems and the origami problems. And the fact that there's so many applications to this is really making people excited who are working in the area. I'm really excited to see what happens with that in the next five years or so."
