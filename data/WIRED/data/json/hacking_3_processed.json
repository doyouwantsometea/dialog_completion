That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't. A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock? But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder."

And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company. Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected. So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys."
