And if it's run outta fuel, it's no longer shining and pushing outward. And without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore. And that's when you form a black hole."

So it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse, it just overcomes all attempts to fight it. If you made something really dense, you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape. That's 300,000 kilometers per second."
