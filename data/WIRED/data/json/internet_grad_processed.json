One of the things that I designed before, starting my PhD with Henning, was a IoT pill dispenser, essentially, which pairs with your smartphone, which does facial detection and other computer vision controls and can basically tell who's taking some sensitive medication and make sure that they've taken it correctly."

So for example, most IoT devices require you, when you're configuring them for you to enter some kind of captive login portal where you connect to a local network that the IoT device produces, and then you can input your Wi-Fi SSID and password. But then say if you were to change the password or the name of your Wi-Fi network or you move to a new place, then suddenly, everything needs to be reconfigured. 'Cause that's a problem that scales linearly."

Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City. Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate. And so there needs to be an intervention here."
