But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?"

We mainly work on population studies. We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD."

We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea."

When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this? Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?"

So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right? And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies. What about kind of beta-amyloid?"

This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate."

I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?"
