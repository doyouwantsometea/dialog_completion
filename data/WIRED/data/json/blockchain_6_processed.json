It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded. It's in the ledger."

We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it. And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments. And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade."
