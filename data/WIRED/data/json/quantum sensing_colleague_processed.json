How improving sensitivity, specificity, what other limits and we define it better, are there fundamental physical limits?"

Which is why, you know, some companies or groups are trying to make quantum computers based on spins and semiconductors 'cause they could be really densely integrated using modern technology. But the question for a sensor is, as you say, how do you address it? How do you initialize it? How do you read it out? And is optics the best way to go? And it may not be. If we think about quantum sensing in particular, it really involves understanding materials, solid state materials, chemicals, you know, chemistry, biology, engineering, electrical engineering, optics, photonics, I mean so many different areas. And I think that that's one of the most exciting things about that is the degree to which it's engaging a much larger cross section of scientists. They're the ones that I think are gonna come up with the breakthroughs of saying, oh wait, I could design this molecule to do this thing."
