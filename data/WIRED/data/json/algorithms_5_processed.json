So, how about social media? Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?"

It's sort of like Netflix recommendations except more constant because it's just every video you scroll, it's like that's a new recommendation basically. And it's based on what you've liked previously, what you've saved previously, what you search up. So, I would assume there's some kind of algorithm there kind of figuring out like what to put on your For You page."

So, the better the algorithm is, the better your engagement is, maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform and so forth. So, it all sort of feeds together. But what you're describing really is more artificially intelligent, if I may, because presumably there's not someone at TikTok or any of these social media companies saying, If Patricia likes this post, then show her this post. If she likes this post, then show her this other post. Because the code would sort of grow infinitely long and there's just way too much content for a programmer to be having those kinds of conditionals, those decisions being made behind the scenes. So, it's probably a little more artificially intelligent. And in that sense you have topics like neural networks, and machine learning which really describe taking as input things like what you watch, what you click on, what your friends watch, what they click on, and sort of trying to infer from that instead, what should we show Patricia or her friends next?"
