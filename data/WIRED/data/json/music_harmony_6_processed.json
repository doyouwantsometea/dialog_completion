You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional. So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?"

You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine. And then tones get increasingly small. Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something. In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards. So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that. Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes."

What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do? What to do, right. And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible.
