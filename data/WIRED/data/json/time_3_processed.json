So that journey may only take you, say, a year, six months out and six months back, but you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years, a million years into the future. Would you do that if you could?"

And I don't know the answer to that, nobody does. We don't know if you can travel back, but we certainly know that you can travel forward."

The limit is the speed of light, because light travels 671 million miles per hour, that is fast enough to go around the entire earth seven times in one second. So if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted. There's something else that's really curious about time. Things tend to go in one direction, and we call it the arrow of time. It sort of points from the past into what we call the future. If you're to ask me why is there an arrow to time, ask me."
