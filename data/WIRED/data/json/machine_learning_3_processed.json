So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples. And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world. When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples. We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are. Do you have tests in school?"
