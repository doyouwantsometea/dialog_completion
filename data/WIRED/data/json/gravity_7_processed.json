I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world. So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there? In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places. There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite."

One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few. It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action. And there's black holes. One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads. It was one of the most beautiful examples."

So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly. I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out. But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely. If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes."

And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole. The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that. If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted. And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron."

And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together.

It's got sort of 3D information built into it. And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it. It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions."

I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it. So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain. Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area. And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram. It's not a principle that only applies to black holes. It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional. That's crazy."

If holography, if this limit on how much information you can ever pack, if that ever become a limit, as far as we know that's an absolute limit.
