The way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something, but it's about doing something efficiently. Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now. Google, I would say for example, is learning every day about like, Oh what articles, what links might be better than others? And re-ranking them. There are recommender systems all around us, right? Like content feeds and social media, or you know, like YouTube or Netflix. What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms."

That's a very simple example of how you can play a game without having anything learned. This is very much, oh you are at a game state, you just search down, see what are the possibilities and then you pick the best possibility that it can see, versus what you think about when you think about, ah yes, gameplay like the alpha zero for example, or alpha star, or there are a lot of, you know, like fancy new machine learning agents that are even learning very difficult games like Go. And those are learned agents, as in they are getting better as they play more and more games. And as they get more games, they kind of refine their strategy based on the data that I've seen. And once again, this high level abstraction is still the same. You see a lot of data and you'll learn from that. But the question is what is objective function that you're optimizing for? Is it winning this game? Is it forcing a tie or is it, you know, opening a door in a kitchen?"

Like even when I was taking the train here, right? The trains are being routed with algorithms, but this has existed for you know, like 50 years probably. But as I was coming here, as I was checking my phone, those are different algorithms, and you know, they're kind of getting all around us, getting there with us all the time. They're making our life better most places, most cases. And I think that's just going to be a continuation of all of those."
