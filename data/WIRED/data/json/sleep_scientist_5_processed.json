So at least seven hours. When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?"

Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep. And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right? And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping."

But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier. Time goes by, you get sleepier. But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up. And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you. So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?"
