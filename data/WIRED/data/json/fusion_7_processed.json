Like tokamaks and accelerators, they have plasmas that are magnetically confined. So we're trying to predict how the plasma behaves, so that we can build in the future better reactors."

The developments in plasma theory and computation and simulation, that has been thoroughly validated over the years, in many experiments, and now we're using those simulations to inform how to best operate our future reactors. It's very exciting because so far we've been getting great results. It's very, very promising."

                    "text": "Where we're going with a lot of the experiments right now is trying to produce some maybe outside-the-box datasets that we haven't seen before, and then of course ultimately compare them to the simulations and do a bit of this validation maybe where we're not just looking under the lamppost, where we're going a little bit outside the comfort zone. That means going from measurements really sort of more in the middle of the plasma, at about mid-radius, pushing all the way out to the edge, where the turbulence starts to become very different in its nature, it becomes a lot more electromagnetic, it becomes sometimes larger in scale, just physical scale size. And some of the things we're starting to find was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas don't always behave the way we think they do. So as we think about pushing our measurements and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge, how does that influence what you're working on now?"

                    "text": "So the edge of the plasma gives you the boundary condition really for the simulations that then we do in the core. You need to start somewhere determining what is the temperature very close to the wall, really, of the machine. And when when you get that temperature, then you can actually integrate inwards with the rest of core model. It's gonna be very exciting in the next years, when we can actually make some measurements in those devices and and compare them to simulations, so that we can have more trust in the predictions for the next step for the reactors, the power plants."

They're actually taking advantages of discoveries in other fields. Like in the case of High Field Fusion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy, those companies, they're using a high temperature superconductor. It's an advancement that has come recently from material science, right. Or machine learning, artificial intelligence. Those breakthroughs in other fields I think can really accelerate fusion. So I think we're seeing, the next decades are gonna be very exciting. We have to the diversify the different research that we do so that at the end we come with the most optimum solution for our fusion power plant."

When I'm asked like, okay, what's the timeline for fusion and why is now any different than five years ago or 10 years ago, why is now that we want for fusion? My answer is it's finally, for the first time, all the pieces of the puzzle are here. We've advanced really the basic physics understanding so far that we have got the predictive capabilities, but we also have alignment with policy and science drivers that we didn't really have before. That's I think what can get us there. Maybe a demonstration of net electricity in a decade. Is that the thing folks are pushing for?"
