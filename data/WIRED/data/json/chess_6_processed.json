Obviously, with material odds, it's gonna be one part of the training, and other part of the training that I find interesting is like, you know, to find positions from, let's say, real life tournaments. And I've been doing that actually from this recent tournament that's going on in Isle of Man, playing out some of those fascinating positions and just seeing what the computer does, and he's like coming up with resources that you would never think of, you know?"

Obviously you try to make it as efficient as possible. We have the saying in chess that, you know, you lost by one tempo, by one move. Space. You know, we have a game of 64 squares, right? So control over these 64 squares is what the game is about. You can get control in moving up your pawns. You can get control by winning opponent's material, right? So obviously, that's another big element that we're fighting over, and harmony is basically like you got this army of pieces, right? Your job is to make them work well with each other, coordinate them, and build that beautiful picture of harmony that, you know, all chess players aim for and are so pleased when they can finally achieve."

I don't know, Levy, if you know this, but I made grandmaster when I was 29. Most people, if they don't do it by the time they're like 20, they'll probably never do it. In terms of becoming a grandmaster, really, that's the time and the commitment. I think if you're an international master like you are, like everything is within reach. Like you've already played chess long enough in your life. You're close enough to that level that, really, it's gonna be little things like putting in the time, going to the best tournaments, and getting the best competition, and just maybe getting a good coach to help you as well.
