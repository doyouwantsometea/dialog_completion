So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley. We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms. It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity. So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid."

You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined. One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens. This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ."

So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori. When you stretch them out they're pretty big."

So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion. And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact. So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one. But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one."

This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color. There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this."
