So today we've been telling people, fractals are things that are somehow self-similar, they have detail at all scales. Are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say, this is what a fractal is?"

I think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vase. And then about three in the morning, I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream into the coffee and I was watching it and I started watching it swirl around. And I realized that what was happening was really simple that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up. And then that folds again. And it's a really simple process of folding within folding. And I just went to the computer and did that."

I have some group of transformations and I look at objects that are sort of in variant with respect to these transformations. So if you just look at translations, okay, what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations? Will you get tiling? You get wallpaper. And if you start asking that same question, what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom, you have fractal."
