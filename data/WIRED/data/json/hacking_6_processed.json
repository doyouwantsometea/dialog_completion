So, security for operating systems. I've been mostly working on a project that limits executables' exposure to bugs in the kernel. It's run by professor Justin Cappos there. He found that the majority of bugs that occur in the Linux kernel happen when you're doing things that people don't do that often, the programs don't do that often. So designing a runtime environment that lets you limit what a certain program has access to, but also the things that it does have access to is also limited to those popular paths in the kernel. So it can't access areas that aren't under more scrutiny."

                    "text": "So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on. A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology. So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU. And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount. And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that. If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it."

                    "text": "So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows. They basically all hold different pieces of memory. That's all the gates are. Either they're turned on or they're turned off. So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place. So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict."

                    "author": "Explainer",
                    "text": "Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage. That's crazy. I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack. Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away. Being able to extract that password is really difficult. If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out. You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool. Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good. It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical. Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point."

The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most. Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices."
