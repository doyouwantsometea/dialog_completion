You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies. But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy. So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave."

And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better? So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity. But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well."

In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise. The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor. One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from? I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz. All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations."

You don't just see the external spins, you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system. So what you wanna do is make sure that they don't interact with each other, but they still stay sensitive to everything else. And there, you could think about the local interactions, the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise. In some ways, it's interfering with what you wanna measure, which is the magnetic field outside the sample."
