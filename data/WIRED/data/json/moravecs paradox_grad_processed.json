When you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation, and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate, it's really hard to actually model the physics of how tofu crumbles."

Mostly because, if it's hard to simulate an interaction with an object, then I think RL is harder to go with, because it's not as sample efficient as imitation learning can be. And a lot of the times I'll be learning some high level policy of what to do, and then hard coding a lot of the, like action primitives that I want to select between my task."

Another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are gonna be useful where the hands actually interact with each other, rather than just off doing their own things. What have you found to be like your go-tos between the different styles?"

And so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data, maybe offline data, then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient."

A lot of simulators, they don't simulate the world as a fine enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewing an object, for example. One thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles, from our knowledge of physics. But instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build, allow robots to build models of the world, build simulators of the world, based on data and based on experiences. There's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem, because if we wanna use simulators to get lots of data, and we also need data to get good simulators, then there's no way to get around this."
