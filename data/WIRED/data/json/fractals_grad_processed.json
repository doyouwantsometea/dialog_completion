And one thing that I think you can be precise about, even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is, is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension. Have you ever heard of that?"

And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension, maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three, there are a lot of different definitions, precise definitions of fractal dimension. But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension. You have, let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape. And you're gonna see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape? So, so if I have a straight line and I start out with one big box that covers the whole line, and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two, I just make boxes half as big. How many boxes will I need to cover that line?"

Perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic. I have a, a random question. Do you know how the research into fractals began? You can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century, people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural. So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor, who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties, or you can have functions with really strange properties. This thing called the devil staircase and so on. And it wasn't until about a century later where someone named Mendel Brock said, Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature. And from there, people really ran with it and said, Oh, okay, well, if these fractal descriptions are good for nature, we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in computer graphics."
