On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder. But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk. The gravity is just way too strong. Do you know how tall you are?"

Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them. [balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time? Did they hit at the same time? So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap. Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force.
