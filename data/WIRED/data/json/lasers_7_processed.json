We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point. But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29. So you're hoping to build the biggest laser."

And then how lasers are wonderful because they allow you to take energy and compress it in space and time. So having high P power is something, it's been a motivator for me for a long time. And so we at the university are making proposals to build two 25 petawatt lasers, maybe 30 petawatt lasers. We'll use them to be able to get combined power of over 10 to the 24 watts per square center. Still far from the Schwinger limit. But we have a trick. We're going to use one of these petawatt lasers to make an electron beam. And this electron beam will be relativistic. We actually think we could make electron beam, maybe even 100s of GeV up to TeV, which would be another Nobel Prize if we did that."

I can see us doing it today, by just exploiting what we already know and taking it to a limit, then that would be a real motivator, I think, to be able to even take these techniques further. Cheating's not the right exact word as taking advantage of relativity. Take advantage of all physics not just optical physics. So that's why we wanna do it this way."

If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers. Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about. So one could possibly see an exawatt from that. People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--"

And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now. For defense applications, for science applications. So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies. Lasers I think have progressed so much.
