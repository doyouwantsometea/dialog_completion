So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past.

And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are. They don't change, the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing. So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment."

But sometimes I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from this kind of paradoxes. So what's pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical proposals for traveling to the past that have come out of physics, you can't travel to a moment in the past before the first time travel machine is built."

Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment. They fire the beam of light left and right. Notice that the beam that they fire to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it. Whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense, they're moving toward it. The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer at the same moment."
