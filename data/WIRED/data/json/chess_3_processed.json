So let's practice. In this position, I had the white pieces. You're playing on my side. My opponent was playing with the black pieces. So we switched a little bit.

So if you and your neighbor have a full fence, you can't really see each other, but if there's only four pawns, that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence, right? So if we start picking up all these pawns, then the position is more open. So this would be a closed position. This type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy 'cause you found a way to get your queen and rook down this line against my king. Before we even talk about what tactic is here, who does it look like is winning this game?"
