That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there, it's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities. Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time? He found that if you and I, say, have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock. But you know what's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant. Have you ever heard that phrase?"

                    "text": "It's much longer, right? This one's going tick-tock, tick. This is gonna go tick, tock. In fact, we can figure out the ratio. Let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock. Well, that ratio is gonna be the ratio of the lengths. Then this would be given by D over L. More time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock. Well, this length over here, that's the same as this L over here, right? So we want D over L. Now, you may have recall that in trigonometry, there's a name for L over D. Sine of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right? And so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta. So if we can figure out 1 over sine theta, we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time and the stationary clock to time on the moving clock, we just need one other fact. The speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C. C equals speed of light. But in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror, the component of the speed of light in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace with the speed of the clock itself. So let's assume that this clock is moving in this direction with the speed equal to V. So C times cosine theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion. And from this, we learn that cosine theta is equal to V over C. There's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry, that sine-squared theta plus cosine-squared theta is equal to 1. This is really just a Pythagorean theorem in disguise. And from that, we can now solve for a sine-squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared. And therefore sine theta is the square root of this. And now, we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine theta, which now is 1 over the square root of 1 minus V over C squared. So you see, as V gets very close to C, this gets very close to 1. 1 minus something very close to 1 is very close to 0. 1 over something close to 0 is huge, which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time on the moving, that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light. Now I did this for a light clock, but it's true for any clock, and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity."
